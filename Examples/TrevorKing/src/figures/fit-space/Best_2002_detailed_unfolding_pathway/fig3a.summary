Best
====

Fitting Best's figure 3a (good-fit region for fitting <F>(v) data).
  k_u^0 = b exp(a x_u)
with a = (-40.7215 ± 0.32)∙10⁹ m⁻¹
and  b = (39.727 ± 4.029) s⁻¹

The quite-good-fit region extends from 
  x_u = 0.308 nm, k_u^0 = 1.41e-4 s⁻¹
to
  x_u = 0.372 nm, k_u^0 = 1.01e-5 s⁻¹

King and comparison
===================

Comparing this to the fit valley for my 2009_sawsim figure
  a = (-44.6235 ± 1.277)∙10⁹ m⁻¹
  b = (25.4465 ± 4.305) s⁻¹
we see that the slopes (a) are the same, and the intercepts (b) are
slightly offset.  This means the orientation of the model valley
dln(k_u0)/dx_u is independent of the particular data set in question,
and instead is an inherent “feature” of our particular model.

Analysis of valley minimum
==========================

If we stick to the "valley floor", extrapolating out another 0.08 nm
in x_u from the King parameters, my generated histogram at
  (x_u = 0.28 nm, k_u0 = 9.535∙10⁻⁵ s⁻¹)
is much narrower (as expected from Gumbel) than the experimental
distribution, although this might be due to a reasonable ammount of
noise or drifty peak extraction spreading the experimental data.
