At the lowest small sphere concentrations, the potential was monotonically attractive, while at higher concentrations an oscillatory potential was observed, due to the liquid structure of the small spheres. Surprisingly, the large spheres came together only rarely at the higher concentrations, suggesting a new means for stabilizing suspensions using entropy alone.},

This force is calculated as a function of concentration, shape, and charge of macromolecules, and it is shown that it becomes stronger in solutions of chain macromolecules or of macromolecules of dissymmetrical shape than in solutions of rigid spherical macromolecules at the same net concentration. If macromolecules have charge, the force can be greatly intensified. In every case numerical estimation is made, and it is found that actually this kind of force can have a remarkable influence on the state of suspended particles. Numerical examples of the critical concentration of particles at their macroscopic aggregation are given.

abstract = {Simple theoretical models are presented to illustrate the effects of spatial confinement and macromolecular crowding on the equilibria and rates of protein folding and binding. Confinement is expected to significantly stabilize the folded state, but for crowding only a marginal effect on protein stability is expected. In confinement the unfolded chain is restricted to a cage but in crowding the unfolded chain may explore different interstitial voids. Because confinement and crowding eliminate the more expanded conformations of the unfolded state, folding from the compact unfolded state is expected to speed up. Crowding will shift the binding equilibrium of proteins toward the bound state. The significant slowing down in protein diffusion by crowding, perhaps beneficial for chaperonin action, could result in a decrease in protein binding rates.

The measured diffusion coefficients are used to test the predictions of the wall drag effect predicted by several approximate theoretical analyses. We find a quantitative agreement with the behavior predicted using a hydrodynamic analysis that independently superimposes the wall drag effects arising from each wall. Our results imply, indirectly, that neglect of multiple interactions with the colloid sphere of the perturbations of the pressure and velocity fields induced by each wall leads to an underestimate of the influence of the wall on the drag force experienced by the particle.},

In this paper we derive the cavity function to second order in density and the fourth virial coefficient as functions of T*≡kBT/vargamma (where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature) for penetrable sphere fluids. The expressions are exact, except for the function represented by an elementary diagram inside the core, which is approximated by a polynomial form in excellent agreement with accurate results obtained by Monte Carlo integration. Comparison with the hypernetted-chain (HNC) and Percus-Yevick (PY) theories shows that the latter is better than the former for T*≲1 only. However, even at zero temperature (hard sphere limit), the PY solution is not accurate inside the overlapping region, where no practical cancellation of the neglected diagrams takes place. The exact fourth virial coefficient is positive for T*≲0.73 , reaches a minimum negative value at T*≈1.1 , and then goes to zero from below as 1/T*4 for high temperatures. These features are captured qualitatively, but not quantitatively, by the HNC and PY predictions. In addition, in both theories the compressibility route is the best one for T*≲0.7 , while the virial route is preferable if T*≳0.7 .},

We explain some subtleties due to the stochastic character of the equations and exploit analyticity in some interesting parts of the dynamics.

Two spheres interact via a ``sticky'' Baxter potential if the line joining the centers of the two spheres intersects a patch on each sphere, and via a hard sphere potential otherwise. We analyze the location of the fluid-fluid transition and of the percolation line as a function of the size of the patch (the fractional coverage of the sphere's surface) and of the number of patches within a virial expansion up to third order and within the first two terms (C0 and C1) of a class of closures Cn hinging on a density expansion of the direct correlation function. We find that the locations of the two lines depend sensitively on both the total adhesive coverage and its distribution. The treatment is almost fully analytical within the chosen approximate theory. We test our findings by means of specialized Monte Carlo simulations and find the main qualitative features of the critical behavior to be well captured in spite of the low density perturbative nature of the closure.

The first is transition interface sampling (TIS), based on the measurement of effective fluxes through hypersurfaces in phase space. TIS improves efficiency with respect to standard transition path sampling (TPS) rate constant techniques, because it allows a variable path length and is less sensitive to recrossings. The second method is the partial path version of TIS. Developed for diffusive processes, it exploits the loss of long time correlation. We discuss the relation between the new techniques and the standard reactive flux methods in detail. Path sampling algorithms can suffer from ergodicity problems, and we introduce several new techniques to alleviate these problems, notably path swapping, stochastic configurational bias Monte Carlo shooting moves and order-parameter free path sampling. In addition, we give algorithms to calculate other interesting properties from path ensembles besides rate constants, such as activation energies and reaction mechanisms.},

However, the time-integrated response of the velocity field around a Brownian particle has exactly the same distance dependence as the velocity field around a particle moving with a constant velocity. This finding elucidates the validity of an assumption used in theoretical descriptions of Brownian particles dynamics in confined geometries and in colloids; namely, that viscous drag forces can be computed as if the particles move with constant velocities.},

Efficiently sampling this ensemble requires avoiding the well-known stiffness problem associated with the sampling of infinitesimal Brownian increments of the path, as well as a different type of stiffness associated with the sampling of the coarse features of long paths. The fine-feature sampling stiffness is eliminated with the use of the fast sampling algorithm, and the coarse-feature sampling stiffness is avoided by introducing the sliding and sampling (S\&S) algorithm. A key feature of the S\&S algorithm is that it enables massively parallel computers to sample diffusive trajectories that are long in time. The authors use the algorithm to sample the transition path ensemble for the structural interconversion of the 38-atom Lennard-Jones cluster at low temperature.},

We calculate the interaction between large spheres (of radius R) in a dilute solution of mutually avoiding small spheres (of diameter [sigma] {\textless}{\textless} R and volume fraction [phi]), to third order in [phi]. In addition to the well-known attractive force for 0 {\textless} h {\textless} [sigma], we find a repulsive barrier at larger separations, and beyond that a secondary minimum. Except for unusually large size ratios (perhaps abetted by relatively high density [phi]), these features of the interaction potential are too small, compared to kBT, for kinetic stabilization (arising from the barrier) or flocculation into the secondary minimum, to be widespread, although such effects are possible in principle. For feasible size ratios, the same features should have observable consequences for the radial distribution function of the large spheres. Such effects can be viewed as precursors, at low density, of liquidlike structuring (solvation forces) expected at higher [phi]. Our third order calculation gives satisfactory agreement with a recent computer simulation at moderate density and size ratio (2R/[sigma] = 10; [phi] = [pi]/15).},

abstract = {Nonspecific interactions between individual macro-molecules and their immediate surroundings (`background interactions') within a medium as heterogeneous and highly volume occupied as the interior of a living cell can greatly influence the equilibria and rates of reactions in which they participate. Background interactions may be either repulsive, leading to preferential size-and-shape-dependent exclusion from highly volume-occupied elements of volume, or attractive, leading to nonspecific associations or adsorption. Nonspecific interactions with different constituents of the cellular interior lead to three classes of phenomena: macromolecular crowding, confinement and adsorption. Theory and experiment have established that predominantly repulsive background interactions tend to enhance the rate and extent of macromolecular associations in solution, whereas predominately attractive background interactions tend to enhance the tendency of macromolecules to associate on adsorbing surfaces. Greater than order-of-magnitude increases in association rate and equilibrium constants attributable to background interactions have been observed in simulated and actual intracellular environments.

Based on some new algebraic conditions on the separation of two ellipses, we reduce collision detection for two moving ellipses to the problem of detecting real roots of a univariate equation, which is the discriminant of the characteristic polynomial of the two ellipses. Several techniques are investigated for robust and accurate processing of this univariate equation for two classes, of commonly used motions: planar cycloidal motions and planar rational motions.

A single-molecule method based on atomic force microscopy {(AFM)} was used to investigate the effects of macromolecular crowding on the forces required to unfold individual protein molecules. It was found that the mechanical stability of ubiquitin molecules was enhanced by macromolecular crowding from added dextran molecules. The average unfolding force increased from 210 {pN} in the absence of dextran to 234 {pN} in the presence of 300 {g/L} dextran at a pulling speed of 0.25 {micro}m/sec. A theoretical model, accounting for the effects of macromolecular crowding on the native and transition states of the protein molecule by applying the scaled-particle theory, was used to quantitatively explain the crowding-induced increase in the unfolding force. The experimental results and interpretation presented could have wide implications for the many proteins that experience mechanical stresses and perform mechanical functions in the crowded environment of the cell.

Using the self-organized polymer {(SOP)} model, which is a coarse-grained representation of polypeptide chains, we probe the mechanical stability of ubiquitin {(Ub)} monomers and trimers {((Ub)(3))} in the presence of monodisperse spherical crowding agents. Crowding increases the volume fraction {(Phi(c))-dependent} average force {(f(u)(Phi(c))),} relative to the value at Phi(c) = 0, needed to unfold Ub and the polyprotein. For a given Phi(c), the values of {f(u)(Phi(c))} increase as the diameter (sigma(c)) of the crowding particles decreases. The average unfolding force {f(u)(Phi(c))} depends on the ratio {D/R(g),} where D approximately {sigma(c)(pi/6Phi(c))(1/3),} with R(g) being the radius of gyration of Ub (or {(Ub)(3))} in the unfolded state. Examination of the unfolding pathways shows that, relative to Phi(c) = 0, crowding promotes reassociation of ruptured secondary structural elements. Both the nature of the unfolding pathways and {f(u)(Phi(c))} for {(Ub)(3)} are altered in the presence of crowding particles, with the effect being most dramatic for the subunit that unfolds last. We predict, based on {SOP} simulations and theoretical arguments, that {f(u)(Phi(c))} approximately Phi(c)(1/3nu), where nu is the Flory exponent that describes the unfolded (random coil) state of the protein.},

title = {Effects of Crowding and Confinement on the Structures of the Transition State Ensemble in Proteins},
volume = {111},
abstract = {Characterization of the structures of the transition state ensemble is a key step in describing the folding reaction. Using two variants of a coarse-grained model of the three-stranded beta-sheet {WW} domain and a fully automated progress variable clustering {(PVC)} algorithm, we have dissected the effect of macromolecular crowding and confinement on the changes in the transition state structures in comparison to bulk. Each amino acid is represented using a Calpha atom and a side chain. The distance between the Calpha atom and center of mass of the side chain is taken to be its effective van der Waals radius. For the bulk case, we predict using the {PVC} algorithm, which does not assume knowledge of the underlying folding reaction coordinate, that there are two classes of structures in the transition state ensemble {(TSE).} The structures in both of the classes are compact. The dominant cluster is more structured than the structures in the less populated class. In accord with bulk experiments, the residues in strands beta2 and beta3 and the interactions at the beta2beta3 interface are structured. When only excluded volume interactions between the crowding particles and the {WW} domain are taken into account or when the protein is confined to an inert spherical pore, the overall structure of the {TSE} does not change dramatically. However, in this entropy dominated regime, the width of the {TSE} decreases and the structures become more oblate and less spherical as the volume fraction of crowding particle increases or when the pore radius decreases. It suggests that the shape changes, which are computed using the moment of inertia tensor, may represent the slow degrees of freedom during the folding process. When non-native interactions between side chains and interactions with the cavity of the pores are taken into account, the {TSE} becomes considerably broader. Although the topology in the transition has a fold similar to the native state, the structures are far more plastic than in the bulk. The {TSE} is sensitive to the size of the pore as well as interactions between the pore and the protein. The differences between the two cases (confinement in an inert pore and when poreprotein interactions are considered) arise due to the increased importance of enthalpic interactions in the transition state as the strength of the proteinpore interaction increases.},

abstract = {The presence of macromolecules in cells geometrically restricts the available space for poplypeptide chains. To study the effects of macromolecular crowding on folding thermodynamics and kinetics, we used an off-lattice model of the all-β-sheet {WW} domain in the presence of large spherical particles whose interaction with the polypeptide chain is purely repulsive. At all volume fractions, ϕ, of the crowding agents the stability of the native state is enhanced. Remarkably, the refolding rates, which are larger than the value at ϕ = 0, increase nonmonotonically as ϕ increases, reaching a maximum at . At high values of ϕ, the depletion-induced intramolecular attraction produces compact structures with considerable structure in the denatured state. Changes in native state stability and folding kinetics at ϕ can be quantitatively mapped onto confinement in a volume-fraction-dependent spherical pore with radius
≈ (4π/3ϕ)

(

title = {Molecular crowding enhances native structure and stability of alpha / beta protein flavodoxin},
volume = {104},
abstract = {To investigate the consequences of macromolecular crowding on the behavior of a globular protein, we performed a combined experimental and computational study on the 148-residue single-domain α/β protein, apoflavodoxin. thermal unfolding experiments, as well as assessment of native and denatured structures, were probed by using {far-UV} {CD} in the presence of various amounts of Ficoll 70, an inert spherical crowding agent. Ficoll 70 has a concentration-dependent effect on the thermal stability of apoflavodoxin (Δ
of {20°C} at 400 mg/ml; {pH} 7). As judged by {CD,} addition of Ficoll 70 causes an increase in the amount of secondary structure in the native-state ensemble {(pH} 7, {20°C)} but only minor effects on the denatured state. Theoretical calculations, based on an off-lattice model and hard-sphere particles, are in good agreement with the data. The simulations demonstrate that, in the presence of 25\% volume occupancy of spheres, native flavodoxin is thermally stabilized, and the free energy landscape shifts to favor more compact structures in both native and denatured states. The difference contact map reveals that the native-state compaction originates in stronger interactions between the helices and the central β-sheet, as well as by less fraying in the terminal helices. This study demonstrates that macromolecular crowding has structural effects on the folded ensemble of polypeptides.

volume = {326},
abstract = {Thermally induced transition curves of hen egg-white lysozyme were measured in the presence of several concentrations of dextran at {pH} 2.0 by {near-UV} and {far-UV} {CD.} The transition curves were fitted to a two-state model by a non-linear, least-squares method to obtain the transition temperature {(T(m)),} enthalpy change {(deltaH(u)(T(m))),} and free energy change {(deltaG(u)(T))} of the unfolding transition. An increase in T(m) and almost constant {deltaH(u)(T(m))} values were observed in the presence of added dextran at concentrations exceeding ca 100 g l(-1). In addition, dextran-induced conformational changes of fully unfolded protein were investigated by {CD} spectroscopy. Addition of high concentrations of dextran to solutions of acid-unfolded cytochrome c at {pH} 2.0 results in a shift of the {CD} spectrum from that characteristic of the fully unfolded polypeptide to that characteristic of the more compact, salt-induced molten globule state, a result suggesting that the molten globule-like state is stabilized relative to the fully unfolded form in crowded environments. Both observations are in qualitative accord with predictions of a previously proposed model for the effect of intermolecular excluded volume (macromolecular crowding) on protein stability and conformation.},

title = {Depletion potential in hard-sphere mixtures: Theory and applications},
volume = {62},
abstract = {We present a versatile density functional approach {(DFT)} for calculating the depletion potential in general fluid mixtures. For the standard situation of a single big particle immersed in a sea of small particles near a fixed object, the system is regarded as an inhomogeneous binary mixture of big and small particles in the external field of the fixed object, and the limit of vanishing density of the big species, ρb→0, is taken explicitly. In this limit our approach requires only the equilibrium density profile of a one-component fluid of small particles in the field of the fixed object, and a knowledge of the density independent weight functions which characterize the mixture functional. Thus, for a big particle near a planar wall or a cylinder or another fixed big particle, the relevant density profiles are functions of a single variable, which avoids the numerical complications inherent in brute force {DFT.} We implement our approach for additive hard-sphere mixtures, comparing our results with computer simulations for the depletion potential of a big sphere of radius Rb in a sea of small spheres of radius Rs near (i) a planar hard wall, and (ii) another big sphere. In both cases our results are accurate for size ratios {s=Rs/Rb} as small as 0.1, and for packing fractions of the small spheres ηs as large as 0.3; these are the most extreme situations for which reliable simulation data are currently available. Our approach satisfies several consistency requirements, and the resulting depletion potentials incorporate the correct damped oscillatory decay at large separations of the big particles or of the big particle and the wall. By investigating the depletion potential for high size asymmetries we assess the regime of validity of the well-known Derjaguin approximation for hard-sphere mixtures and argue that this fails, even for very small size ratios s, for all but the smallest values of ηs where the depletion potential reduces to the {Asakura-Oosawa} potential. We provide an accurate parametrization of the depletion potential in hard-sphere fluids, which should be useful for effective Hamiltonian studies of phase behavior and colloid structure. Our results for the depletion potential in a hard-sphere system, with a size ratio s=0.0755 chosen to mimic a recent experiment on a colloid-colloid mixture, are compared with the experimental data. Although there is good overall agreement, in particular for the dependence of the oscillations on ηs, there are some significant differences at high values of ηs.},

abstract = {In theoretical studies on the depletion interaction between macromolecules in crowding media, usually only the macromolecules and large cosolutes are considered by assuming that the solvent can be treated as an inert background. Here, the interaction between macromolecules immersed in a solvent–cosolute mixture is calculated using the integral equation theories combined with a hard-sphere model. On the basis of the results, we point out the crucial importance of explicit incorporation of solvent molecules in the theoretical treatment. The behavior observed is highly nonlinear due to the complicated intermolecular correlations and remarkably dependent on the total packing fraction and the cosolute concentration. An example result is that the cosolute can act both as a stabilizer and as a destabilizer for a dimer of macromolecules.

A new method is described to approximate the pair correlation function. A discussion is given of the structure of the Mayer type of diagrams which correspond to the different contributions to the pair correlation function. The method takes into account in the successive steps of the approximation, diagrams of increasing complexity as regards "the basic structure", a concept which is fully defined in this paper in §5. In each step of the approximation an infinity of diagrams, corresponding to density terms up to infinite order, is included. Numerical calculations are in progress for evaluating the pair correlation function in the "zeroth" approximation, which takes into account all diagrams, which can be obtained by successive series and parallel connection of subdiagrams, using the single bond as starting element. It is possible that also the next step in the approximation, including diagrams of a more complex basic structure, can be made with high speed computors.},
