\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:sawsim:conclusions}

We have described the method of performing Monte Carlo simulations
based on a simple two-state model for the mechanical unfolding of
protein molecules and discussed the complications involved in the
simulation procedure.  Besides its use in this thesis,
\sawsim\ analysis has been used in \xref{roman12}{figure}{75}.  In
addition to the extraction of kinetic properties of the protein from
mechanical unfolding data, such simulations can help to elucidate the
effects of various experimental parameters on the appearance of force
curves and to estimate the errors associated with data pooling.  To
date, the force-induced unfolding approach has been used to
investigate several different types of proteins.  As the technique is
used to study a wider range of proteins, this simple simulation method
will be useful for data analysis, experimental design, and artifact
identification.
