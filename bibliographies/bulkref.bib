We study the dynamical behavior of the error in the calculation of the density of states. We conclude that the source of the saturation of the error is due to the decreasing variations of the refinement parameter. To overcome this limitation, we present an analytical treatment in which the refinement parameter is scaled down as a power law instead of exponentially. An extension of the analysis to the N-fold way variation of the method is also discussed.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with the presence of amyloid-? {(A?)} peptide fibrillar plaques in the brain. However, current evidence suggests that soluble nonfibrillar A? oligomers may be the major drivers of A?-mediated synaptic dysfunction. Structural information on these A? species has been very limited because of their noncrystalline and unstable nature. Here, we describe a crystal structure of amylogenic residues 18-41 of the A? peptide (equivalent to the p3 ?/?-secretase fragment of amyloid precursor protein) presented within the {CDR3} loop region of a shark Ig new antigen receptor {(IgNAR)} single variable domain antibody. The predominant oligomeric species is a tightly associated A? dimer, with paired dimers forming a tetramer in the crystal caged within four {IgNAR} domains, preventing uncontrolled amyloid formation. Our structure correlates with independently observed features of small nonfibrillar A? oligomers and reveals conserved elements consistent with residues and motifs predicted as critical in A? folding and oligomerization, thus potentially providing a model system for nonfibrillar oligomer formation in Alzheimer's disease.},

It was then seen in early studies of synthetic polypeptides and, of course, is now known to be present in a variety of guises as an essential component of globular protein structures. However, in the last decade or so it has become clear that the beta-conformation of chains is present not only in many of the amyloid structures associated with, for example, Alzheimer's Disease, but also in the prion structures associated with the spongiform encephalopathies. Furthermore, X-ray crystallography studies have revealed the high incidence of the beta-fibrous proteins among virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria and viruses. Here we describe the basic forms of the beta-fold, summarize the many different new forms of beta-structural fibrous arrangements that have been discovered, and review advances in structural studies of amyloid and prion fibrils.

abstract = {Recent studies support the hypothesis that soluble oligomers of amyloid {beta}-peptide {(A{beta})} rather than mature amyloid fibrils are the earliest effectors of synaptic compromise in Alzheimer's disease. We took advantage of an amyloid precursor protein-overexpressing cell line that secretes {SDS-stable} A{beta} oligomers to search for inhibitors of the pathobiological effects of natural human A{beta} oligomers. Here, we identify small molecules that inhibit formation of soluble A{beta} oligomers and thus abrogate their block of long-term potentiation {(LTP).} Furthermore, we show that cell-derived A{beta} oligomers can be separated from monomers by size exclusion chromatography under nondenaturing conditions and that the isolated, soluble oligomers, but not monomers, block {LTP.} The identification of small molecules that inhibit early A{beta} oligomer formation and rescue {LTP} inhibition offers a rational approach for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease and highlights the utility of our cell-culture paradigm as a useful secondary screen for compounds designed to inhibit early steps in A{beta} oligomerization under biologically relevant conditions.},

abstract = {We have characterized amyloid [beta] peptide {(A[beta].} concentration, A[beta] deposition, paired helical filament formation, cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy, apolipoprotein E {(ApoE)} allotype, and synaptophysin concentration in entorhinal cortex and superior frontal gyrus of normal elderly control {(ND)} patients, Alzheimer's disease {(AD.} patients, and high pathology control {(HPC)} patients who meet pathological criteria for {AD} but show no synapse loss or overt antemortem symptoms of dementia. The measures of A[beta] deposition, A[beta]-immunoreactive plaques with and without cores, thioflavin histofluorescent plaques, and concentrations of insoluble A[beta], failed to distinguish {HPC} from {AD} patients and were poor correlates of synaptic change. By contrast, concentrations of soluble A[beta] clearly distinguished {HPC} from {AD} patients and were a strong inverse correlate of synapse loss. Further investigation revealed that A[beta]40, whether in soluble or insoluble form, was a particularly useful measure for classifying {ND,} {HPC,} and {AD} patients compared with A[beta]42. A[beta]40 is known to be elevated in cerebrovascular amyloid deposits, and A[beta]40 (but not A[beta]42) levels, cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy, and {ApoE4} allele frequency were all highly correlated with each other. Although paired helical filaments in the form of neurofibrillary tangles or a penumbra of neurites surrounding amyloid cores also distinguished {HPC} from {AD} patients, they were less robust predictors of synapse change compared with soluble A[beta], particularly soluble A[beta]40. Previous experiments attempting to relate A[beta] deposition to the neurodegeneration that underlies {AD} dementia may have failed because they assayed the classical, visible forms of the molecule, insoluble neuropil plaques, rather than the soluble, unseen forms of the molecule.},

Advances in computing and connectivity make it possible to develop computational models and capture and analyze unprecedented amounts of experimental and observational data to address problems previously deemed intractable.

These inadequacies compromise {U.S.} scientific leadership, economic competitiveness, and national security.

To initiate the required transformation, the Federal government, in partnership with academia and industry, must also create and execute a multi-decade roadmap directing coordinated advances in computational science and its applications in science and engineering disciplines. The Federal government must rebalance {R\&D} investments to create a new generation of well-engineered, scalable, easy-to-use software suitable for computational science that can reduce the complexity and time to solution for today's challenging scientific applications and can create accurate models and simulations that answer new questions; design, prototype, and evaluate new hardware that can deliver larger fractions of peak hardware performance on key applications; and focus on sensor- and data-intensive computational science applications in light of the explosive growth of data.},

Neurodegenerative diseases are proteinopathies associated with misbehavior and disarrangement of a specific protein, affecting its processing, functioning, and/or folding. Many proteins associated with human neurodegenerative diseases are intrinsically disordered; i.e., they lack stable tertiary and/or secondary structure under physiological conditions in vitro. Intrinsically disordered proteins {(IDPs)} have broad presentation in nature. Functionally, they complement ordered proteins, being typically involved in regulation, signaling and control. Structures and functions of {IDPs} are intensively modulated by alternative splicing and posttranslational modifications. It is recognized now that nanoimaging offers a set of tools to analyze protein misfolding and self-assembly via monitoring the aggregation process, to visualize protein aggregates, and to analyze properties of these aggregates. The major goals of this review are to show the interconnections between intrinsic disorder and human neurodegenerative diseases and to overview a recent progress in development of novel nanoimaging tools to follow protein aggregation.},

abstract = {Using lattice statistical mechanics, we develop theory to account for the folding of a heteropolymer molecule such as a protein to the globular and soluble state. Folding is assumed to be driven by the association of solvophobic monomers to avoid solvent and opposed by the chain configurational entropy. Theory predicts a phase transition as a function of temperature or solvent character. Molecules that are too short or too long or that have too few solvophobic residues are predicted not to fold. Globular molecules should have a largely solvophobic core, but there is an entropic tendency for some residues to be "out of place", particularly in small molecules. For long chains, molecules comprised of globular domains are predicted to be thermodynamically more stable than spherical molecules. The number of accessible conformations in the globular state is calculated to be an exceedingly small fraction of the number available to the random coil. Previous estimates of this number, which have motivated kinetic theories of folding, err by many tens of orders of magnitude.},

We use a Ising-like model to partially account for the dihedral angle entropy and, implicitly, the hydrogen-bond formations. We also compare our results to recent experiments and find good quantitative agreement on the predicted folded fraction. On the basis of the predictions from the scaled particle theory, we investigate changes in the melting temperature of the protein, suggesting crowding enhanced stability for a variant of trpzip hairpin and a slight instability for the larger ?-sheet designed proteins.},

volume = {62},
shorttitle = {Reaction-rate theory},
abstract = {The calculation of rate coefficients is a discipline of nonlinear science of importance to much of physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology. Fifty years after Kramers' seminal paper on thermally activated barrier crossing, the authors report, extend, and interpret much of our current understanding relating to theories of noise-activated escape, for which many of the notable contributions are originating from the communities both of physics and of physical chemistry. Theoretical as well as numerical approaches are discussed for single- and many-dimensional metastable systems (including fields) in gases and condensed phases. The role of many-dimensional transition-state theory is contrasted with Kramers' reaction-rate theory for moderate-to-strong friction; the authors emphasize the physical situation and the close connection between unimolecular rate theory and Kramers' work for weakly damped systems. The rate theory accounting for memory friction is presented, together with a unifying theoretical approach which covers the whole regime of weak-to-moderate-to-strong friction on the same basis (turnover theory). The peculiarities of noise-activated escape in a variety of physically different metastable potential configurations is elucidated in terms of the mean-first-passage-time technique. Moreover, the role and the complexity of escape in driven systems exhibiting possibly multiple, metastable stationary nonequilibrium states is identified. At lower temperatures, quantum tunneling effects start to dominate the rate mechanism. The early quantum approaches as well as the latest quantum versions of Kramers' theory are discussed, thereby providing a description of dissipative escape events at all temperatures. In addition, an attempt is made to discuss prominent experimental work as it relates to Kramers' reaction-rate theory and to indicate the most important areas for future research in theory and experiment.},

abstract = {We describe the master equation method for computing the kinetics of protein folding. We illustrate the method using a simple Go model. Presently most models of two-state fast-folding protein folding kinetics invoke the classical idea of a transition state to explain why there is a single exponential decay in time. However, if proteins fold via funnel-shaped energy landscapes, as predicted by many theoretical studies, then it raises the question of what is the transition state. Is it a specific structure, or a small ensemble of structures, as is expected from classical transition state theory? Or is it more like the denatured states of proteins, a very broad ensemble? The answer that is usually obtained depends on the assumptions made about the transition state. The present method is a rigorous way to find transition states, without assumptions or approximations, even for very nonclassical shapes of energy landscapes. We illustrate the method here, showing how the transition states in two-state protein folding can be very broad ensembles.},

shorttitle = {Maximum Caliber},
abstract = {We show how to apply a general theoretical approach to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, called Maximum Caliber, originally suggested by E. T. Jaynes {[Annu.} Rev. Phys. Chem. 31, 579 (1980)], to a problem of two-state dynamics. Maximum Caliber is a variational principle for dynamics in the same spirit that Maximum Entropy is a variational principle for equilibrium statistical mechanics. The central idea is to compute a dynamical partition function, a sum of weights over all microscopic paths, rather than over microstates. We illustrate the method on the simple problem of two-state dynamics, {A{\textless}--{\textgreater}B,} first for a single particle, then for M particles. Maximum Caliber gives a unified framework for deriving all the relevant dynamical properties, including the microtrajectories and all the moments of the time-dependent probability density. While it can readily be used to derive the traditional master equation and the Langevin results, it goes beyond them in also giving trajectory information. For example, we derive the Langevin noise distribution rather than assuming it. As a general approach to solving nonequilibrium statistical mechanics dynamical problems, Maximum Caliber has some advantages: (1) It is partition-function-based, so we can draw insights from similarities to equilibrium statistical mechanics. (2) It is trajectory-based, so it gives more dynamical information than population-based approaches like master equations; this is particularly important for few-particle and single-molecule systems. (3) It gives an unambiguous way to relate flows to forces, which has traditionally posed challenges. (4) Like Maximum Entropy, it may be useful for data analysis, specifically for time-dependent phenomena.},

Among other interesting properties, this metric asymptotically bounds the dissipation induced by a finite time transformation of a thermodynamic system. It is also connected to the {Jensen-Shannon} divergence, Fisher information, and Rao{\textquoteright}s entropy differential metric. Therefore, thermodynamic length is of central interest in understanding matter out of equilibrium. In this Letter, we will consider how to define thermodynamic length for a small system described by equilibrium statistical mechanics and how to measure thermodynamic length within a computer simulation. Surprisingly, Bennett{\textquoteright}s classic acceptance ratio method for measuring free energy differences also measures thermodynamic length.},
