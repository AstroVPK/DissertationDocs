        coincides with expression of biological recognition sites that are

        assembly of Fn into fibrillar matrix enables cells to mechanically
        regulate its structure, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer
        (FRET) as an indicator of Fn conformation in the fibrillar matrix of
        NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Fn was randomly labeled on amine residues with
        donor fluorophores and site-specifically labeled on cysteine residues
        in modules FnIII7 and FnIII15 with acceptor fluorophores.
        Intramolecular FRET was correlated with known structural changes of Fn
        in denaturing solution, then applied in cell culture as an indicator of
        Fn conformation within the matrix fibrils of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Based
        on the level of FRET, Fn in many fibrils was stretched by cells so that
        its dimer arms were extended and at least one FnIII module unfolded.
        When cytoskeletal tension was disrupted using cytochalasin D, FRET
        increased, indicating refolding of Fn within fibrils. These results
        suggest that cell-generated force is required to maintain Fn in
        partially unfolded conformations. The results support a model of Fn
        fibril elasticity based on unraveling and refolding of FnIII modules.
        We also observed variation of FRET between and along single fibrils,
        indicating variation in the degree of unfolding of Fn in fibrils.
        Molecular mechanisms by which mechanical force can alter the structure
        of Fn, converting tensile forces into biochemical cues, are discussed."

    using old and new theory for Brownian motion in an incompressible

    motion, a central aspect of this motion in incompressible fluids
    has not been verified experimentally: the thermal noise that
    drives the Brownian particle, is not white, as in Einstein's
    simple theory. It is slightly coloured, due to hydrodynamics and
    the fluctuation--dissipation theorem. This theoretical result from
    the 1970s was prompted by computer simulation results in apparent
    violation of Einstein's theory. We discuss how a direct
    experimental observation of this colour might be carried out by
    using optical tweezers to separate the thermal noise from the
    particle's dynamic response to it. Since the thermal noise is

        shows, contrary to previous supposition, that the heterogeneous folding
        kinetics observed for the staphylococcal nuclease protein (SNase) does
        not require alternative parallel pathways. SNase folding kinetics can
        be fit equally well by a single predetermined pathway that allows for
        optional misfolding errors, which are known to occur ubiquitously in
        protein folding. Structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic information for

        provide direct quantitation of the strength of adhesive contact for
        large agglutinin-bonded regions between macroscopically smooth membrane
        capsules (e.g., red blood cells). The approach yields intrinsic
        properties for separation of adherent regions independent of mechanical
        deformation of the membrane capsules during detachment. Conceptually,
        the micromechanical method involves one rigid test-capsule surface (in
        the form of a perfect sphere) held fixed by a micropipette and a second
        deformable capsule maneuvered with another micropipette to force
        contact with the test capsule. Only the test capsule is bound with
        agglutinin so that the maximum number of cross-bridges can be formed
        without steric interference. Following formation of a large adhesion
        region by mechanical impingement, the deformable capsule is detached
        from the rigid capsule surface by progressive aspiration into the
        micropipette. For the particular case modeled here, the deformable
        capsule is assumed to be a red blood cell which is preswollen by slight
        osmotic hydration before the test. The caliber of the detachment
        pipette is chosen so that the capsule will form a smooth cylindrical
        ``piston'' inside the pipette as it is aspirated. Because of the high
        flexibility of the membrane, the capsule naturally seals against the
        tube wall by pressurization even though it does not adhere to the
        glass. This arrangement maintains perfect axial symmetry and prevents
        the membrane from folding or buckling. Hence, it is possible to
        rigorously analyze the mechanics of deformation of the cell body to
        obtain the crucial ``transducer'' relation between pipette suction
        force and the membrane tension applied directly at the perimeter of the
        adhesive contact. Further, the geometry of the cell throughout the
        detachment process is predicted which provides accurate specification
        of the contact angle theta c between surfaces at the perimeter of the
        contact. A full analysis of red cell capsules during detachment has
        been carried out; however, it is shown that the shear rigidity of the
        red cell membrane can often be neglected so that the red cell can be
        treated as if it were an underfilled lipid bilayer vesicle. From the
        analysis, the mechanical leverage factor (1-cos theta c) and the
        membrane tension at the contact perimeter are determined to provide a
        complete description of the local mechanics of membrane separation as
        functions of large-scale experimental variables (e.g., suction force,
        contact diameter, overall cell length).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400

        Unfolding rates calculated from simulations over a broad range of

        to a force-dependent process at high force, akin to the ``roll-over''
        in unfolding rates sometimes seen in studies using chemical denaturant.
        While such a turnover in rates is unexpected in one dimension, we
        demonstrate that it can occur for dynamics in just two dimensions. We
        relate the turnover to the quality of the pulling direction as a
        reaction coordinate for the intrinsic folding mechanism. A novel
        pulling direction, designed to be the most relevant to the intrinsic

        accord with protein engineering experiments and simulations which
        indicate that the unfolding mechanism at high force can differ from the

        can be described and understood by taking a statistical approach to the

        The statistical energy landscape approach explains when and why unique

        and more generally explains the distinction between folding processes
        common to all sequences and those peculiar to individual sequences.
        This approach also gives new, quantitative insights into the
        interpretation of experiments and simulations of protein folding
        thermodynamics and kinetics. Specifically, the picture provides simple
        explanations for folding as a two-state first-order phase transition,
        for the origin of metastable collapsed unfolded states and for the
        curved Arrhenius plots observed in both laboratory experiments and
        discrete lattice simulations. The relation of these quantitative ideas

        assay that uses force spectroscopy to directly probe the functional

        protein-ligand complexes. As a proof of principle, we used protein G

        Fc to protein G does not induce major structural changes in protein G
        but results in significant enhancement of its mechanical stability.
        Using mechanical stability of protein G as an intrinsic functional
        reporter, we directly distinguished and quantified Fc-bound and Fc-free
        forms of protein G on a single-molecule basis and accurately determined

        using an atomic-force-microscope-based single-molecule manipulation
        technique. The ubiquitin molecule was highly resistant to a stretching
        force, and the mechanical unfolding process was reversible. A model
        calculation based on the hydrogen-bonding pattern in the native
        structure was performed to explain the origin of this high mechanical
        stability. Furthermore, pH effects were studied and it was found that

        range around the neutral value, and forces decreased as the solution pH
        was lowered to more acidic values.",

        include conformational changes of the adhesion complex is proposed,

        the rupture strength of a molecular-point attachment (focal bond)
        between two macroscopically smooth membrane capsules. In the procedure,
        one capsule is prepared with a low density coverage of adhesion
        molecules, formed as a stiff sphere, and held at fixed position by a
        micropipette. The second capsule without adhesion molecules is
        pressurized into a spherical shape with low suction by another pipette.
        This capsule is maneuvered to initiate point contact at the pole
        opposite the stiff capsule which leads to formation of a few (or even
        one) molecular attachments. Then, the deformable capsule is slowly
        withdrawn by displacement of the pipette. Analysis shows that the end-
        to-end extension of the capsule provides a direct measure of the force
        at the point contact and, therefore, the rupture strength when
        detachment occurs. The range for point forces accessible to this
        technique depends on the elastic moduli of the membrane, membrane
        tension, and the size of the capsule. For biological and synthetic
        vesicle membranes, the range of force lies between 10(-7)-10(-5) dyn
        (10(-12)-10(-10) N) which is 100-fold less than presently measurable by
        Atomic Force Microscopy! Here, the approach was used to study the
        forces required to rupture microscopic attachments between red blood
        cells formed by a monoclonal antibody to red cell membrane glycophorin,
        anti-A serum, and a lectin from the snail-helix pomatia. Failure of the
        attachments appeared to be a stochastic function of the magnitude and
        duration of the detachment force. We have correlated the statistical
        behavior observed for rupture with a random process model for failure
        of small numbers of molecular attachments. The surprising outcome of
        the measurements and analysis was that the forces deduced for short-
        time failure of 1-2 molecular attachments were nearly the same for all
        of the agglutinin, i.e., 1-2 x 10(-6) dyn. Hence, microfluorometric
        tests were carried out to determine if labeled agglutinins and/or
        labeled surface molecules were transferred between surfaces after
        separation of large areas of adhesive contact. The results showed that
        the attachments failed because receptors were extracted from the

        Biophys. J. 59:861-872), a method was developed to quantitate the
        strength of adhesion between agglutinin-bonded membranes without
        ambiguity due to mechanical compliance of the cell body. The
        experimental method and analysis were formulated around controlled
        assembly and detachment of a pair of macroscopically smooth red blood
        cell surfaces. The approach provides precise measurement of the
        membrane tension applied at the perimeter of an adhesive contact and
        the contact angle theta c between membrane surfaces which defines the
        mechanical leverage factor (1-cos theta c) important in the definition
        of the work to separate a unit area of contact. Here, the method was
        applied to adhesion and detachment of red cells bound together by
        different monoclonal antibodies to red cell membrane glycophorin and
        the snail-helix pomatia-lectin. For these tests, one of the two red
        cells was chemically prefixed in the form of a smooth sphere then
        equilibrated with the agglutinin before the adhesion-detachment
        procedure. The other cell was not exposed to the agglutinin until it
        was forced into contact with the rigid cell surface by mechanical
        impingement. Large regions of agglutinin bonding were produced by
        impingement but no spontaneous spreading was observed beyond the forced
        contact. Measurements of suction force to detach the deformable cell
        yielded consistent behavior for all of the agglutinins: i.e., the
        strength of adhesion increased progressively with reduction in contact
        diameter throughout detachment. This tension-contact diameter behavior
        was not altered over a ten-fold range of separation rates. In special
        cases, contacts separated smoothly after critical tensions were
        reached; these were the highest values attained for tension. Based on
        measurements reported in another paper (Evans et al. 1991. Biophys. J.
        59:838-848) of the forces required to rupture molecular-point
        attachments, the density of cross-bridges was estimated with the
        assumption that the tension was proportional to the discrete rupture
        force x the number of attachments per unit length. These estimates
        showed that only a small fraction of agglutinin formed cross-bridges at
        initial assembly and increased progressively with separation. When
        critical tension levels were reached, it appeared that nearly all local
        agglutinin was involved as cross-bridges. Because one cell surface was
        chemically fixed, receptor accumulation was unlikely; thus, microscopic
        ``roughness'' and steric repulsion probably modulated formation of
        cross-bridges on initial contact.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

        interfaces arise mainly from weak noncovalent interactions. These bonds
        will fail under any level of pulling force if held for sufficient time.
        Thus, when tested with ultrasensitive force probes, we expect cohesive
        material strength and strength of adhesion at interfaces to be time-
        and loading rate-dependent properties. To examine what can be learned
        from measurements of bond strength, we have extended Kramers' theory
        for reaction kinetics in liquids to bond dissociation under force and
        tested the predictions by smart Monte Carlo (Brownian dynamics)
        simulations of bond rupture. By definition, bond strength is the force
        that produces the most frequent failure in repeated tests of breakage,
        i.e., the peak in the distribution of rupture forces. As verified by
        the simulations, theory shows that bond strength progresses through
        three dynamic regimes of loading rate. First, bond strength emerges at
        a critical rate of loading (> or = 0) at which spontaneous dissociation
        is just frequent enough to keep the distribution peak at zero force. In
        the slow-loading regime immediately above the critical rate, strength
        grows as a weak power of loading rate and reflects initial coupling of
        force to the bonding potential. At higher rates, there is crossover to
        a fast regime in which strength continues to increase as the logarithm
        of the loading rate over many decades independent of the type of
        attraction. Finally, at ultrafast loading rates approaching the domain
        of molecular dynamics simulations, the bonding potential is quickly
        overwhelmed by the rapidly increasing force, so that only naked
        frictional drag on the structure remains to retard separation. Hence,
        to expose the energy landscape that governs bond strength, molecular
        adhesion forces must be examined over an enormous span of time scales.
        However, a significant gap exists between the time domain of force
        measurements in the laboratory and the extremely fast scale of
        molecular motions. Using results from a simulation of biotin-avidin
        bonds (Izrailev, S., S. Stepaniants, M. Balsera, Y. Oono, and K.

        rate, the breakage time specifies the force for most frequent failure
        (called bond strength) that obeys the same dependence on loading rate.
        The spectrum of bond strength versus log(loading rate) provides an
        image of the energy landscape traversed in the course of unbonding.
        However, when a weak bond is connected to very compliant elements like
        long polymers, the load applied to the bond does not rise steadily
        under constant pulling speed. Because of nonsteady loading, the most
        frequent breakage force can differ significantly from that of a bond
        loaded at constant rate through stiff linkages. Using generic models

        process of failure for a bond loaded by pulling the polymer linkages at
        constant speed. We find that when linked by either type of polymer

    and bead was found to be quantized in integer multiples of
    $160\pm20$ piconewtons for biotin and $85\pm15$ piconewtons for

        system for studying high-affinity protein-ligand interactions. We
        report here crystallographic studies elucidating the conformation of
        the flexible binding loop of streptavidin (residues 45 to 52) in the
        unbound and bound forms. The crystal structures of unbound streptavidin
        have been determined in two monoclinic crystal forms. The binding loop
        generally adopts an open conformation in the unbound species. In one
        subunit of one crystal form, the flexible loop adopts the closed
        conformation and an analysis of packing interactions suggests that
        protein-protein contacts stabilize the closed loop conformation. In the
        other crystal form all loops adopt an open conformation. Co-
        crystallization of streptavidin and biotin resulted in two additional,
        different crystal forms, with ligand bound in all four binding sites of
        the first crystal form and biotin bound in only two subunits in a
        second. The major change associated with binding of biotin is the
        closure of the surface loop incorporating residues 45 to 52. Residues
        49 to 52 display a $3_{10}$ helical conformation in unbound subunits of
        our structures as opposed to the disordered loops observed in other
        structure determinations of streptavidin. In addition, the open
        conformation is stabilized by a $\beta$-sheet hydrogen bond between
        residues 45 and 52, which cannot occur in the closed conformation. The
        $3_{10}$ helix is observed in nearly all unbound subunits of both the co-
        crystallized and ligand-free structures. An analysis of the temperature
        factors of the binding loop regions suggests that the mobility of the
        closed loops in the complexed structures is lower than in the open
        loops of the ligand-free structures. The two biotin bound subunits in
        the tetramer found in the MONO-b1 crystal form are those that
        contribute Trp 120 across their respective binding pockets, suggesting
        a structural link between these binding sites in the tetramer. However,
        there are no obvious signatures of binding site communication observed
        upon ligand binding, such as quaternary structure changes or shifts in
        the region of Trp 120. These studies demonstrate that while
        crystallographic packing interactions can stabilize both the open and
        closed forms of the flexible loop, in their absence the loop is open in
        the unbound state and closed in the presence of biotin. If present in
        solution, the helical structure in the open loop conformation could
        moderate the entropic penalty associated with biotin binding by
        contributing an order-to-disorder component to the loop closure.",

        It allows researchers to predict the age-related failure kinetics for a
        system of given architecture (reliability structure) and given
        reliability of its components. Reliability theory predicts that even
        those systems that are entirely composed of non-aging elements (with a
        constant failure rate) will nevertheless deteriorate (fail more often)
        with age, if these systems are redundant in irreplaceable elements.
        Aging, therefore, is a direct consequence of systems redundancy.
        Reliability theory also predicts the late-life mortality deceleration
        with subsequent leveling-off, as well as the late-life mortality
        plateaus, as an inevitable consequence of redundancy exhaustion at
        extreme old ages. The theory explains why mortality rates increase
        exponentially with age (the Gompertz law) in many species, by taking
        into account the initial flaws (defects) in newly formed systems. It
        also explains why organisms ``prefer'' to die according to the Gompertz
        law, while technical devices usually fail according to the Weibull
        (power) law. Theoretical conditions are specified when organisms die
        according to the Weibull law: organisms should be relatively free of
        initial flaws and defects. The theory makes it possible to find a
        general failure law applicable to all adult and extreme old ages, where
        the Gompertz and the Weibull laws are just special cases of this more
        general failure law. The theory explains why relative differences in
        mortality rates of compared populations (within a given species) vanish
        with age, and mortality convergence is observed due to the exhaustion
        of initial differences in redundancy levels. Overall, reliability
        theory has an amazing predictive and explanatory power with a few, very
        general and realistic assumptions. Therefore, reliability theory seems
        to be a promising approach for developing a comprehensive theory of
        aging and longevity integrating mathematical methods with specific

        interact with the thin filaments, possibly affecting the molecule's
        elastic behavior. Indeed, several studies have indicated that
        interactions between titin and actin occur in vitro and may occur in
        the sarcomere as well. To explore the properties of titin alone, one
        must first eliminate the modulating effect of the thin filaments by
        selectively removing them. In the present work, thin filaments were
        selectively removed from the cardiac myocyte by using a gelsolin
        fragment. Partial extraction left behind approximately 100-nm-long thin
        filaments protruding from the Z-line, whereas the rest of the I-band
        became devoid of thin filaments, exposing titin. By applying a much
        more extensive gelsolin treatment, we also removed the remaining short
        thin filaments near the Z-line. After extraction, the extensibility of
        titin was studied by using immunoelectron microscopy, and the passive
        force-sarcomere length relation was determined by using mechanical
        techniques. Titin's regional extensibility was not detectably affected
        by partial thin-filament extraction. Passive force, on the other hand,
        was reduced at sarcomere lengths longer than approximately 2.1 microm,
        with a 33 +/- 9\% reduction at 2.6 microm. After a complete extraction,
        the slack sarcomere length was reduced to approximately 1.7 microm. The
        segment of titin near the Z-line, which is otherwise inextensible,
        collapsed toward the Z-line in sarcomeres shorter than approximately
        2.0 microm, but it was extended in sarcomeres longer than approximately
        2.3 microm. Passive force became elevated at sarcomere lengths between
        approximately 1.7 and approximately 2.1 microm, but was reduced at
        sarcomere lengths of >2.3 microm. These changes can be accounted for by
        modeling titin as two wormlike chains in series, one of which increases
        its contour length by recruitment of the titin segment near the Z-line
        into the elastic pool."

    abstract = {Precise manipulation of single molecules has already led to
        remarkable insights in physics, chemistry, biology and medicine.
        However, widespread adoption of single-molecule techniques has been
        impeded by equipment cost and the laborious nature of making
        measurements one molecule at a time. We have solved these issues with a
        new approach: massively parallel single-molecule force measurements
        using centrifugal force. This approach is realized in a novel
        instrument that we call the Centrifuge Force Microscope (CFM), in which
        objects in an orbiting sample are subjected to a calibration-free,
        macroscopically uniform force-field while their micro-to-nanoscopic
        motions are observed. We demonstrate high-throughput single-molecule
        force spectroscopy with this technique by performing thousands of
        rupture experiments in parallel, characterizing force-dependent
        unbinding kinetics of an antibody-antigen pair in minutes rather than
        days. Additionally, we verify the force accuracy of the instrument by
        measuring the well-established DNA overstretching transition at 66
        $\pm$ 3 pN. With significant benefits in efficiency, cost, simplicity,
        and versatility, "single-molecule centrifugation" has the potential to
        revolutionize single-molecule experimentation, and open access to a
        wider range of researchers and experimental systems.}

        is believed to play a major role in extensibility and passive
        elasticity of muscle. In the I-band, the titin sequence consists mostly
        of repetitive motifs of tandem immunoglobulin-like (Ig) modules
        intercalated by a potentially non-globular region. The highly
        repetitive titin architecture suggests that the molecular basis of its
        mechanical properties be approached through the characterization of the
        isolated components of the I-band and their interfaces. In the present
        paper, we report on the structure determination in solution of a
        representative Ig module from the I-band (I27) as solved by NMR
        techniques. RESULTS. The structure of I27 consists of a beta sandwich
        formed by two four-stranded sheets (named ABED and A'GFC). This fold
        belongs to the intermediate frame (I frame) of the immunoglobulin
        superfamily. Comparison of I27 with another titin module from the
        region located in the M-line (M5) shows that two loops (between the B
        and C and the F and G strands) are shorter in I27, conferring a less
        elongated appearance to this structure. Such a feature is specific to
        the Ig domains in the I-band and might therefore be related to the
        functions of the protein in this region. The structure of tandem Ig
        domains as modeled from I27 suggests the presence of hinge regions

        this diversity, one common feature can be identified in the simulated

        Tenascin-X plays important roles in regulating the structure and
        mechanical properties of connective tissues. Using single-molecule
        atomic force microscopy, we have investigated the mechanical properties
        of bovine tenascin-X in detail. Our results indicated that tenascin-X
        is an elastic protein and the fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains can
        unfold under a stretching force and refold to regain their mechanical
        stability upon the removal of the stretching force. All the 30 FnIII
        domains of tenascin-X show similar mechanical stability, mechanical
        unfolding kinetics, and contour length increment upon domain unfolding,
        despite their large sequence diversity. In contrast to the homogeneity
        in their mechanical unfolding behaviors, FnIII domains fold at
        different rates. Using the 10th FnIII domain of tenascin-X (TNXfn10) as
        a model system, we constructed a polyprotein chimera composed of
        alternating TNXfn10 and GB1 domains and used atomic force microscopy to
        confirm that the mechanical properties of TNXfn10 are consistent with
        those of the FnIII domains of tenascin-X. These results lay the

        the elastic response and structure of single molecules and oligomers of
        titin, we carried out molecular force spectroscopy and atomic force
        microscopy (AFM) on purified full-length skeletal-muscle titin. From

        obtained for the single, unfolded titin molecule. Furthermore, data
        suggest that titin molecules may globally associate into oligomers

        Consistent with this, AFM of surface-adsorbed titin molecules revealed
        the presence of oligomers. Although oligomers may form globally via
        head-to-head association of titin, the constituent molecules otherwise

        native state unfolded at 100(+/-20) pN, elongating (10)FNIII by
        12(+/-2) nm and reaching a clearly marked intermediate that unfolded at
        50(+/-20) pN. Unfolding of the intermediate completed the elongation of

        mutagenesis of residues in the A and B beta-strands (E9P and L19P)
        resulted in sawtooth patterns with all-or-none unfolding events that
        elongated the molecule by 19(+/-2) nm. In contrast, mutating residues
        in the G beta-strand gave results that were dependent on amino acid
        position. The mutation I88P in the middle of the G beta-strand resulted
        in native like unfolding sawtooth patterns showing an intact
        intermediate state. The mutation Y92P, which is near the end of G beta-
        strand, produced sawtooth patterns with all-or-none unfolding events
        that lengthened the molecule by 17(+/-2) nm. These results are
        consistent with the view that 10FNIII can unfold in two different ways.
        Along one pathway, the detachment of the A and B beta-strands from the
        body of the folded module constitute the first unfolding event,
        followed by the unfolding of the remaining beta-sandwich structure.
        Along the second pathway, the detachment of the G beta-strands is
        involved in the first unfolding event. These results are in excellent
        agreement with the sequence of events predicted by molecular dynamics

        unfolding-refolding and mechanisms by which biomolecular elasticity is
        attained. We outline recent work combining protein engineering and AFM
        force spectroscopy to establish the mechanical behavior of titin
        domains using molecular ``fingerprinting.'' Furthermore, we summarize
        AFM force-extension data demonstrating different mechanical stabilities
        of distinct molecular-spring elements in titin, compare AFM force-
        extension to novel force-ramp/force-clamp studies, and elaborate on
        exciting new results showing that AFM force clamp captures the
        unfolding and refolding trajectory of single mechanical proteins. Along
        the way, we discuss the physiological implications of the findings, not
        least with respect to muscle mechanics. These studies help us
        understand how proteins respond to forces in cells and how
        mechanosensing and mechanosignaling events may proceed in vivo."

        lengths. To elucidate this region's contribution to titin elasticity,
        we measured the elastic properties of the N-terminal I-band Ig region
        by using immunofluorescence/immunoelectron microscopy and myofibril
        mechanics and tried to simulate the results with a model of entropic
        polymer elasticity. Rat psoas myofibrils were stained with titin-
        specific antibodies flanking the Ig region at the N terminus and C
        terminus, respectively, to record the extension behaviour of that titin
        segment. The segment's end-to-end length increased mainly at small
        stretch, reaching approximately 90\% of the native contour length of
        the Ig region at a sarcomere length of 2.8 microm. At this extension,
        the average force per single titin molecule, deduced from the steady-
        state passive length-tension relation of myofibrils, was approximately
        5 or 2.5 pN, depending on whether we assumed a number of 3 or 6 titins
        per half thick filament. When the force-extension curve constructed for
        the Ig region was simulated by the wormlike chain model, best fits were
        obtained for a persistence length, a measure of the chain's bending
        rigidity, of 21 or 42 nm (for 3 or 6 titins/half thick filament), which
        correctly reproduced the curve for sarcomere lengths up to 3.4 microm.
        Systematic deviations between data and fits above that length indicated
        that forces of >30 pN per titin strand may induce unfolding of Ig
        modules. We conclude that stretches of at least 5-6 Ig domains, perhaps
        coinciding with known super repeat patterns of these titin modules in
        the I-band, may represent the unitary lengths of the wormlike chain.
        The poly-Ig regions might thus act as compliant entropic springs that
        determine the minute levels of passive tension at low extensions of a
        muscle fiber."

        evidenced by the ionic-strength dependency of titin-based myofibril
        stiffness; at high stretch, hydrophobic effects also might become
        relevant. Thus, at physiological muscle lengths, the PEVK region does
        not function as a pure entropic spring. Rather, PEVK elasticity may
        have both entropic and enthalpic origins characterizable by a polymer

        14 A on the unfolding pathway that protects the domain against
        stretching. Previous simulations showed that this barrier is due to the

        beta-strands A' and G that is preceded by the breaking of two to three
        hydrogen bonds between strands A and B, the latter leading to an

        the breaking of the H-bond between strands A' and G needs to be
        assisted by fluctuations of water molecules. In nanosecond simulations,
        water molecules are found to repeatedly interact with the protein

        cardiac titin. Here we report the elongation of these molecules using
        the atomic force microscope. We find an abrupt extension of each domain
        by approximately 7 A before the first unfolding event. This fast
        initial extension before a full unfolding event produces a reversible
        'unfolding intermediate' Steered molecular dynamics simulations show
        that the rupture of a pair of hydrogen bonds near the amino terminus of
        the protein domain causes an extension of about 6 A, which is in good
        agreement with our observations. Disruption of these hydrogen bonds by
        site-directed mutagenesis eliminates the unfolding intermediate. The
        unfolding intermediate extends titin domains by approximately 15\% of
        their slack length, and is therefore likely to be an important
        previously unrecognized component of titin elasticity."

        In other words, the pioneering early AFM measurements represent only a

        transition state half-way to the native state. Estimates of the
        position of the transition state along an appropriate reaction
        coordinate can be obtained from linear free energy relationships
        observed for folding and unfolding rate constants as a function of
        denaturant concentration. The experimental results of Huang and Oas for
        lambda repressor, Fersht and collaborators for C12, and Gray and
        collaborators for cytochrome c indicate a free energy barrier midway
        between the folded and unfolded regions. This barrier arises from an
        entropic bottleneck for the folding process. RESULTS: In keeping with
        the experimental results, lattice simulations based on the folding
        funnel description show that the transition state is not just a single
        conformation, but rather an ensemble of a relatively large number of
        configurations that can be described by specific values of one or a few
        order parameters (e.g. the fraction of native contacts). Analysis of
        this transition state or bottleneck region from our lattice simulations
        and from atomistic models for small alpha-helical proteins by Boczko
        and Brooks indicates a broad distribution for native contact
        participation in the transition state ensemble centered around 50\%.
        Importantly, however, the lattice-simulated transition state ensemble
        does include some particularly hot contacts, as seen in the
        experiments, which have been termed by others a folding nucleus.
        CONCLUSIONS: Linear free energy relations provide a crude spectroscopy
        of the transition state, allowing us to infer the values of a reaction
        coordinate based on the fraction of native contacts. This bottleneck
        may be thought of as a collection of delocalized nuclei where different
        native contacts will have different degrees of participation. The
        agreement between the experimental results and the theoretical
        predictions provides strong support for the landscape analysis."

        myocardium. Because the titin spring is extended during diastolic
        stretch, it will recoil elastically during systole and potentially may
        influence the overall shortening behavior of cardiac muscle. Here,
        titin elastic recoil was quantified in single human heart myofibrils by
        using a high-speed charge-coupled device-line camera and a
        nanonewtonrange force sensor. Application of a slack-test protocol
        revealed that the passive shortening velocity (Vp) of nonactivated
        cardiomyofibrils depends on: (i) initial sarcomere length, (ii)
        release-step amplitude, and (iii) temperature. Selective digestion of
        titin, with low doses of trypsin, decelerated myofibrillar passive
        recoil and eventually stopped it. Selective extraction of actin
        filaments with a Ca2+-independent gelsolin fragment greatly reduced the
        dependency of Vp on release-step size and temperature. These results
        are explained by the presence of viscous forces opposing myofibrillar
        passive recoil that are caused mainly by weak actin-titin interactions.
        Thus, Vp is determined by two distinct factors: titin elastic recoil
        and internal viscous drag forces. The recoil could be modeled as that
        of a damped entropic spring consisting of independent worm-like chains.
        The functional importance of myofibrillar elastic recoil was addressed
        by comparing instantaneous Vp to unloaded shortening velocity, which
        was measured in demembranated, fully Ca2+-activated, human cardiac
        fibers. Titin-driven passive recoil was much faster than active
        unloaded shortening velocity in early phases of isotonic contraction.
        Damped myofibrillar elastic recoil could help accelerate active
        contraction speed of human myocardium during early systolic
        shortening."

        These nanofibers have a segmented substructure. The segment length and
        amino acid sequence are consistent with a slab-like shape for
        individual silk protein molecules. The height and width of nanofiber

        Atomic force microscopy and laser tweezer experiments have been used to
        stretch titin molecules to more than ten times their folded lengths. To
        explain the observed relation between force and extension, it has been
        suggested that the immunoglobulin and fibronectin domains unfold one at
        a time in an all-or-none fashion. We use molecular dynamics simulations
        to study the forced unfolding of two different fibronectin type 3
        domains (the ninth, 9Fn3, and the tenth, 10Fn3, from human fibronectin)
        and of their heterodimer of known structure. An external biasing
        potential on the N to C distance is employed and the protein is treated
        in the polar hydrogen representation with an implicit solvation model.
        The latter provides an adiabatic solvent response, which is important
        for the nanosecond unfolding simulation method used here. A series of
        simulations is performed for each system to obtain meaningful results.
        The two different fibronectin domains are shown to unfold in the same
        way along two possible pathways. These involve the partial separation
        of the ``beta-sandwich'', an essential structural element, and the
        unfolding of the individual sheets in a stepwise fashion. The biasing
        potential results are confirmed by constant force unfolding
        simulations. For the two connected domains, there is complete unfolding
        of one domain (9Fn3) before major unfolding of the second domain
        (10Fn3). Comparison of different models for the potential energy
        function demonstrates that the dominant cohesive element in both
        proteins is due to the attractive van der Waals interactions;
        electrostatic interactions play a structural role but appear to make
        only a small contribution to the stabilization of the domains, in
        agreement with other studies of beta-sheet stability. The unfolding
        forces found in the simulations are of the order of those observed
        experimentally, even though the speed of the former is more than six
        orders of magnitude greater than that used in the latter."

        mechanism for mechanical unfolding of T4 lysozyme, a small protein
        composed of two subdomains. We observed that on stretching from its N

        by overcoming a dominant unfolding kinetic barrier; and a small
        fraction of T4 lysozymes unfold in three-state fashion involving

        diversity in individual unfolding pathways. The unfolding intermediate
        states are local energy minima along the mechanical unfolding pathways

        individual molecules, and the subsequent, often stepwise unfolding is
        recorded in force extension traces. However, because the energy
        barriers of the folding potentials are often close to the thermal
        energy, both the extensions and the forces at which these barriers are

        these proteins belong to only two distinct protein folds, Ig-like
        $\beta$ sandwich fold and $\beta$-grasp fold, significantly hindering
        delineating molecular determinants of mechanical stability and rational
        tuning of mechanical properties. Here we combine single-molecule atomic

        a mechanically stable protein fold that is distinct from Ig-like $\beta$

        mechanical stability, demonstrating that the direct connectivity of
        force-bearing $\beta$ strands in shear topology is not mandatory for

        comparison-a variation of a text or book comparison method, using word

        show how the optimal resolution range can be determined with English
        books which have been transformed into long character strings by
        removing all punctuation and spaces. (ii) Next, we test the robustness

        Finally, to illustrate the utility of the method, phylogenies are
        reconstructed from concatenated mammalian intronic genomes; the FFP
        derived intronic genome topologies for each l within the optimal range
        are all very similar. The topology agrees with the established

    abstract = "Visualizing the navigation of an ensemble of unfolded molecules
        through the bumpy energy landscape in search of the native state gives
        a pictorial view of biomolecular folding. This picture, when combined
        with concepts in polymer theory, provides a unified theory of RNA and
        protein folding. Just as for proteins, the major folding free energy
        barrier for RNA scales sublinearly with the number of nucleotides,
        which allows us to extract the elusive prefactor for RNA folding.
        Several folding scenarios can be anticipated by considering variations
        in the energy landscape that depend on sequence, native topology, and
        external conditions. RNA and protein folding mechanism can be described
        by the kinetic partitioning mechanism (KPM) according to which a
        fraction () of molecules reaches the native state directly, whereas the
        remaining fraction gets kinetically trapped in metastable
        conformations. For two-state folders 1. Molecular chaperones are
        recruited to assist protein folding whenever is small. We show that the
        iterative annealing mechanism, introduced to describe chaperonin-
        mediated folding, can be generalized to understand protein-assisted RNA
        folding. The major differences between the folding of proteins and RNA
        arise in the early stages of folding. For RNA, folding can only begin
        after the polyelectrolyte problem is solved, whereas protein collapse
        requires burial of hydrophobic residues. Cross-fertilization of ideas
        between the two fields should lead to an understanding of how RNA and
        proteins solve their folding problems.",

        determines the mean unbinding force. If interested in intrinsic

        euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-
        genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was
        generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads
        (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones
        made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-
        genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each
        combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome
        effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a
        2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced,
        without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure
        used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage
        in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in
        the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage.
        The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely
        agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover
        the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90\% of the
        genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25\% of the
        genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the
        genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which
        there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately
        12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak
        supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost
        half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large
        tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is
        spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the genome
        being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size
        up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and
        reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis
        indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal
        function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the
        hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the
        consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations
        of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of
        human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average,
        but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across
        the genome. Less than 1\% of all SNPs resulted in variation in
        proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional
        consequences remains an open challenge."

  abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been a powerful
    instrument that provides nanoscale imaging of surface features,
    mainly of rigid metal or ceramic surfaces that can be insulators
    as well as conductors. Since it has been demonstrated that AFM
    could be used in aqueous environment such as in water or various
    buffers from which physiological condition can be maintained, the
    scope of the application of this imaging technique has been
    expanded to soft biological materials. In addition, the main usage
    of AFM has been to image the material and provide the shape of
    surface, which has also been diversified to molecular-recognition
    imaging - functional force imaging through force spectroscopy and
    modification of AFM cantilevers. By immobilizing of certain
    molecules at the end of AFM cantilever, specific molecules or
    functionalities can be detected by the combination of intrinsic
    feature of AFM and chemical modification technique of AFM
    cantilever. The surface molecule that is complementary to the
    molecule at the end of AFM probe can be investigated via
    specificity of molecule-molecule interaction.(cont.) Thus, this
    AFM cantilever chemistry, or chemical functionalization of AFM
    cantilever for the purpose of chemomechanical surface
    characterization, can be considered as an infinite source of
    applications important to understanding biological materials and
    material interactions. This thesis is mainly focused on three
    parts: (1) AFM cantilever chemistry that introduces specific
    protocols in details such as adsorption method, gold chemistry,
    and silicon nitride cantilever modification; (2) validation of
    cantilever chemistry such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
    (XPS), AFM blocking experiment, and fluorescence microscopy,
    through which various AFM cantilever chemistry is verified; and

        sampling of individual ligand-receptor complex dissociation events,
        disparities in measured unbinding force F(R) among these methods lead
        to marked variation in inferred binding energetics and kinetics at
        equilibrium. These discrepancies are documented for even the ubiquitous
        ligand-receptor pair, biotin-streptavidin. We investigated these
        disparities and examined atomic-level unbinding trajectories via
        steered molecular dynamics simulations, as well as via molecular force
        spectroscopy experiments on biotin-streptavidin. In addition to the
        well-known loading rate dependence of F(R) predicted by Bell's model,
        we find that experimentally accessible parameters such as the effective
        stiffness of the force transducer k can significantly perturb the
        energy landscape and the apparent unbinding force of the complex for
        sufficiently stiff force transducers. Additionally, at least 20\%
        variation in unbinding force can be attributed to minute differences in
        initial atomic positions among energetically and structurally
        comparable complexes. For force transducers typical of molecular force
        spectroscopy experiments and atomistic simulations, this energy barrier
        perturbation results in extrapolated energetic and kinetic parameters
        of the complex that depend strongly on k. We present a model that
        explicitly includes the effect of k on apparent unbinding force of the
        ligand-receptor complex, and demonstrate that this correction enables
        prediction of unbinding distances and dissociation rates that are
        decoupled from the stiffness of actual or simulated molecular linkers.",

        chains. The dynamic behaviour of this model under strain-controlled
        conditions has been fully analysed in the literature. However, despite
        the importance of the Rouse model, no analysis has been made so far of
        the orientational anisotropy of the Rouse eigenmodes during the stress-
        controlled, creep and recovery processes. For completeness of the
        analysis of the model, the Rouse equation of motion is solved to
        calculate this anisotropy for monodisperse chains and their binary
        blends during the creep/recovery processes. The calculation is simple
        and straightforward, but the result is intriguing in the sense that
        each Rouse eigenmode during these processes has a distribution in the
        retardation times. This behaviour, reflecting the interplay/correlation
        among the Rouse eigenmodes of different orders (and for different
        chains in the blends) under the constant stress condition, is quite
        different from the behaviour under rate-controlled flow (where each
        eigenmode exhibits retardation/relaxation associated with a single
        characteristic time). Furthermore, the calculation indicates that the
        Rouse chains exhibit affine deformation on sudden imposition/removal of
        the stress and the magnitude of this deformation is inversely
        proportional to the number of bond vectors per chain. In relation to

        depends on the local structure of the mature domain adjacent to the

        the unfolding pathway can be changed and, therefore, the unfolding rate
        increased. Atomic force microscopy studies find that the local

        This result demonstrated that the transgene was present at the end of

        Direct evidence for chromosomal truncation came from the results of

  abstract = "Macromolecules can occupy a large fraction of the volume
    of a cell and this crowded environment influences the behavior and
    properties of the proteins, such as mechanical unfolding forces,
    thermal stability and rates of folding and diffusion. Although
    much is already known about molecular crowding, it is not well
    understood how it affects a protein’s resistance to mechanical
    stress in a crowded environment and how the size of the crowders
    affect those changes. An atomic force microscope-based single
    molecule method was used to measure the effects of the crowding on
    the mechanical stability of a model protein, in this case I-27. As
    proteins tend to aggregate, single molecule methods provided a way
    to prevent aggregation because of the very low concentration of
    proteins in the solution under study. Dextran was used as the
    crowding agent with three different molecular weights 6kDa, 10 kDa
    and 40 kDa, with concentrations varying from zero to 300 grams per
    liter in a pH neutral buffer solution at room temperature. Results
    showed that the forces required to unfold biomolecules were
    increased when a high concentration of crowder molecules were
    added to the buffer solution and that the maximum force required
    to unfold a domain was when the crowder size was 10 kDa, which is
    comparable to the protein size. Unfolding rates obtained from
    Monte Carlo simulations showed that they were also affected in the
    presence of crowders. As a consequence, the energy barrier was
    also affected. These effects were most notable when the size of
    the crowder was 10 kDa, comparable to the size of the protein. On
    the other hand, distances to the transition state did not seem to
    change when crowders were added to the solution. The effect of
    Dextran on the energy barrier was modeled by using established
    theories such as Ogston’s and scaled particle theory, neither of
    which was completely convincing at describing the results. It can
    be hypothesized that the composition of Dextran plays a role in
    the deviation of the predicted behavior with respect to the
    experimental data.",

                 single-molecule method based on atomic force microscopy

                 letter, we report using a facile physical vapor
                 deposition method to achieve periodic polyethylene (PE)
                 oligomer patterning on individual CNTs. Upon heating
                 under vacuum, PE degraded into oligomers and
                 crystallized into rod-shaped single crystals. These PE
                 rods periodically decorate on CNTs with their long axes
                 perpendicular to the CNT axes. The formation mechanism
                 was attributed to ``soft epitaxy'' growth of PE
                 oligomer crystals on CNTs. Both SWNTs and MWNTs were

                 depositing PE vapor on MWNTs detached from the solid

                 transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, this
                 hybrid structure formation depends critically on CNT
                 surface chemistry: alkane-modification of the MWNT
                 surface prohibited the PE single-crystal growth on the

  abstract = {Recently, direct measurements of forces stabilizing
    single proteins or individual receptor-ligand bonds became
    possible with ultra-sensitive force probe methods like the atomic
    force microscope (AFM). In force spectroscopy experiments using
    AFM, a single molecule or receptor-ligand pair is tethered between
    the tip of a micromachined cantilever and a supporting
    surface. While the molecule is stretched, forces are measured by
    the deflection of the cantilever and plotted against extension,
    yielding a force spectrum characteristic for each biomolecular
    system. In order to obtain statistically relevant results, several
    hundred to thousand single-molecule experiments have to be
    performed, each resulting in a unique force spectrum. We developed
    software and algorithms to analyse large numbers of force
    spectra. Our algorithms include the fitting polymer extension
    models to force peaks as well as the automatic alignment of
    spectra.  The aligned spectra allowed recognition of patterns of
    peaks across different spectra. We demonstrate the capabilities of
    our software by analysing force spectra that were recorded by
    unfolding single transmembrane proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin
    and NhaA. Different unfolding pathways were detected by
    classifying peak patterns. Deviant spectra, e.g. those with no
    attachment or erratic peaks, can be easily identified.  The
    software is based on the programming language C++, the GNU
    Scientific Library (GSL), the software WaveMetrics IGOR Pro and
    available open-source at http://bioinformatics.org/fskit/.},

    the dynamic strength of the system is probed at different force
    loading rates. This is usually achieved by varying the pulling
    speed between a few nm/s and a few $\mu$m/s, although for a more
    complete investigation of the kinetic properties higher speeds are
    desirable. Above 10 $\mu$m/s, the hydrodynamic drag force acting
    on the AFM cantilever reaches the same order of magnitude as the
    molecular forces. This has limited the maximum pulling speed in
    AFM single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments. Here, we
    present an approach for considering these hydrodynamic effects,
    thereby allowing a correct evaluation of AFM force measurements
    recorded over an extended range of pulling speeds (and thus

    comprehension of the structure and dynamics of early intermediates
    leading to the aggregated states is an unsolved problem of
    essential importance to researchers attempting to decipher the
    molecular mechanisms of $\alpha$Syn aggregation and formation of
    fibrils.  Traditional bulk techniques used so far to solve this
    problem point to a direct correlation between $\alpha$Syn's unique
    conformational properties and its propensity to aggregate, but
    these techniques can only provide ensemble-averaged information
    for monomers and oligomers alike.  They therefore cannot
    characterize the full complexity of the conformational equilibria
    that trigger the aggregation process.  We applied atomic force
    microscopy-based single-molecule mechanical unfolding methodology
    to study the conformational equilibrium of human wild-type and
    mutant $\alpha$Syn.  The conformational heterogeneity of monomeric
    $\alpha$Syn was characterized at the single-molecule level.  Three
    main classes of conformations, including disordered and
    ``$\beta$-like'' structures, were directly observed and quantified
    without any interference from oligomeric soluble forms.  The
    relative abundance of the ``$\beta$-like'' structures
    significantly increased in different conditions promoting the
    aggregation of $\alpha$Syn: the presence of \Cu, the pathogenic
    A30P mutation, and high ionic strength.  This methodology can
    explore the full conformational space of a protein at the
    single-molecule level, detecting even poorly populated conformers
    and measuring their distribution in a variety of biologically
    important conditions.  To the best of our knowledge, we present
    for the first time evidence of a conformational equilibrium that
    controls the population of a specific class of monomeric
    $\alpha$Syn conformers, positively correlated with conditions
    known to promote the formation of aggregates.  A new tool is thus
    made available to test directly the influence of mutations and
    pharmacological strategies on the conformational equilibrium of
    monomeric $\alpha$Syn.},

    multimodular proteins. The relationship between the histograms of
    the unfolding forces for different peaks, corresponding to a
    different number of not-yet-unfolded protein modules, is exploited
    in such a manner that the sole distribution of the forces for one
    unfolding peak can be used to predict the unfolding forces for
    other peaks. The scheme is based on a bootstrap prediction method
    and does not rely on any specific kinetic model for multimodular
    unfolding. It is tested and validated in both
    theoretical/computational contexts (based on stochastic
    simulations) and atomic force microscopy experiments on (GB1)(8)
    multimodular protein constructs. The prediction accuracy is so
    high that the predicted average unfolding forces corresponding to
    each peak for the GB1 construct are within only 5 pN of the
    averaged directly-measured values. Experimental data are also used
    to illustrate how the limitations of standard kinetic models can
    be aptly circumvented by the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present thesis is to investigate several
    aspects of: the proteins mechanics, interprotein interactions and
    to study also new techniques, theoretical and technical, to obtain
    and analyze the force spectroscopy experiments. The first section
    is dedicated to the statistical properties of the unfolding forces
    in a chain of homomeric multimodular proteins. The basic idea of
    this kind of statistic is to divide the peaks observed in a force
    extension curve in separate groups and then analyze these groups
    considering their position in the force curves. In fact in a
    multimodular homomeric protein the unfolding force is related to
    the number of not yet unfolded modules (we call it "N"). Such
    effect yields to a linear dependence of the most probable
    unfolding force of a peak on ln(N). We demonstrate how such
    dependence can be used to extract the kinetic parameters and how,
    ignoring it, could lead to significant errors. Following this
    topic we continue with non kinetic methods that, using the
    resampling from the rupture forces of any peak, could reconstruct
    the rupture forces for all the other peaks in a chain. Then a
    discussion about the Monte Carlo simulation for protein pulling is
    present. In fact a theoretical framework for such methodology has
    to be introduced to understand the various simulations done. In
    this chapter we also introduce a methodology to study the ligand
    receptor interactions when we directly functionalize the AFM tip
    and the substrate. In fact, in many of our experiments, we see a
    "cloud of points" in the force vs loading rate graph. We have
    modeled a system composed by "N" parallel springs, and studying
    the distribution of forces obtained in the force vs loading rate
    graph we have establish a procedure to restore the kinetic
    parameters used. Such procedure has then been used to discuss real
    experiments similar to biotin-avidin interaction. In the following
    chapter we discuss a first order approximation of the Bell-Evans
    model where a more explicit form of the potential is
    considered. In particular the dependence of the curvature of the
    potential on the applied force at the minimum and at the
    metastable state is considered. In the well known Bell-Evans model
    the prefactors of the transition rate are fixed at any force,
    however this is not what happen in nature, where the prefactors
    (that are the second local derivative of the interacting energy
    with respect to the reaction coordinate in its minimum and
    maximum) depend on the force applied. The results obtained with
    the force spectroscopy of the Laminin-binding-protein are
    discussed, in particular this protein showed a phase transition
    when the pH was changed. The behavior of this protein changes,
    from a normal WLC behavior to a plateau behavior. The analysis of
    the force spectroscopy curves shows a distribution of length where
    the maximum of the first prominent peak correspond to the full
    length of the protein. However, length that could be associated
    with dimers and trymers are also present in this
    distribution. Later a new approach to study the lock and key
    mechanism, using "handles" with a specific force extension
    pattern, is introduced. In particular handles of (I27)3 and
    (I27–SNase)3 were biochemically attached to: strept-actin
    molecules, biotin molecules, RNase and Angiogenin. The main idea
    is to have a system composed by "handle-(molecule A)-(molecule
    B)-handle" where the handles are covalently attached to the
    respective molecules and the two molecules "A and B" are attached
    by secondary bonds. This approach allows a better recognition of
    the protein-protein interaction enabling us to filter out spurious
    events. Doing a statistic on the rupture forces and comparing this
    with the statistic of the detachments of the system of the bare
    handles, we are able to extract the information of the interaction
    between the molecule A and B. The two last chapters are of more
    preliminary character that the previous part of the thesis. A
    section is dedicated to the estimation of effective mass and
    viscous drag of the cantilevers studied by autocorrelation and
    noise power spectrum. Usually the noise power spectrum method is
    the most used, however the autocorrelation should give
    approximately the same information. The parameters obtained are
    important in high frequency modulation techniques. In fact, they
    are needed to interpret the results. The results of these two
    methods show a good agreement in the estimation of the mass and
    the viscous drag of the various cantilever used. Afterwards a
    chapter is dedicated to the discussion of the force spectroscopy
    experiments using a low frequency modulation of the cantilever
    base. Such experiments allow us to record the phase and the
    amplitude shift of the modulation signal used. Using the amplitude
    channel we managed to restore the static force signal with a lower
    level of noise. Moreover these signals give us direct information
    about the dynamic stiffness and the lose of energy in the system,
    information that, using the standard technique would be difficult
    (or even impossible) to obtain.},

    Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), which is a leading
    cause of renal failure. The available evidence suggests that PC1
    acts as a mechanosensor, receiving signals from the primary cilia,
    neighboring cells, and extracellular matrix. PC1 is a large
    membrane protein that has a long N-terminal extracellular region
    (about 3000 aa) with a multimodular structure including sixteen
    Ig-like PKD domains, which are targeted by many naturally
    occurring missense mutations. Nothing is known about the effects
    of these mutations on the biophysical properties of PKD
    domains. In addition, PC1 is expressed along the renal tubule,
    where it is exposed to a wide range of concentration of urea. Urea
    is known to destabilize proteins. Other osmolytes found in the
    kidney such as sorbitol, betaine and TMAO are known to counteract
    urea's negative effects on proteins. Nothing is known about how
    the mechanical properties of PC1 are affected by these
    osmolytes. Here I use nano-mechanical techniques to study the
    effects of missense mutations and effects of denaturants and
    various osmolytes on the mechanical properties of PKD
    domains. Several missense mutations were found to alter the
    mechanical stability of PKD domains resulting in distinct
    mechanical phenotypes. Based on these findings, I hypothesize that
    missense mutations may cause ADPKD by altering the stability of
    the PC1 ectodomain, thereby perturbing its ability to sense
    mechanical signals. I also found that urea has a significant
    impact on both the mechanical stability and refolding rate of PKD
    domains. It not only lowers their mechanical stability, but also
    slows down their refolding rate. Moreover, several osmolytes were
    found to effectively counteract the effects of urea. Our data
    provide the evidence that naturally occurring osmolytes can help
    to maintain Polycystin-1 mechanical stability and folding
    kinetics. This study has the potential to provide new therapeutic
    approaches (e.g. through the use of osmolytes or chemical
    chaperones) for rescuing destabilized and misfolded PKD domains.",

    systems, dynamic force spectra, which are plots of bond strength
    vs loge(loading rate), have been acquired in a recent biomembrane
    force probe (BFP) study at force loading rates in the range
    0.05--60 000 pN/s. In the present study, the dynamic force spectrum
    of the biotin--streptavidin bond strength in solution was extended
    from loading rates of ∼104 to ∼107 pN/s with the atomic force
    microscope (AFM). A Poisson statistical analysis method was
    applied to extract the magnitude of individual bond-rupture forces
    and nonspecific interactions from the AFM force--distance curve
    measurements. The bond strengths were found to scale linearly with
    the logarithm of the loading rate. The nonspecific interactions
    also exhibited a linear dependence on the logarithm of loading
    rate, although not increasing as rapidly as the specific
    interactions. The dynamic force spectra acquired here with the AFM
    combined well with BFP measurements by Merkel et al. The combined
    spectrum exhibited two linear regimes, consistent with the view
    that multiple energy barriers are present along the unbinding
    coordinate of the biotin--streptavidin complex. This study
    demonstrated that unbinding forces measured by different
    techniques are in agreement and can be used together to obtain a
    dynamic force spectrum covering 9 orders of magnitude in loading
    rate.",

    mode is capable of effecting displacements on an angstrom scale
    (10 A = 1 nm) and measuring forces of a few piconewtons. Recent
    experiments have applied AFM techniques to study the mechanical
    properties of single biological polymers.  These properties
    contribute to the function of many proteins exposed to mechanical
    strain, including components of the extracellular matrix
    (ECM). The force-bearing proteins of the ECM typically contain
    multiple tandem repeats of independently folded domains, a common
    feature of proteins with structural and mechanical
    roles. Polysaccharide moieties of adhesion glycoproteins such as
    the selectins are also subject to strain. Force-induced extension
    of both types of molecules with the AFM results in conformational
    changes that could contribute to their mechanical function. The
    force-extension curve for amylose exhibits a transition in
    elasticity caused by the conversion of its glucopyranose rings
    from the chair to the boat conformation. Extension of multi-domain
    proteins causes sequential unraveling of domains, resulting in a
    force-extension curve displaying a saw tooth pattern of peaks. The
    engineering of multimeric proteins consisting of repeats of
    identical domains has allowed detailed analysis of the mechanical
    properties of single protein domains. Repetitive extension and
    relaxation has enabled direct measurement of rates of domain
    unfolding and refolding. The combination of site-directed
    mutagenesis with AFM can be used to elucidate the amino acid
    sequences that determine mechanical stability. The AFM thus offers
    a novel way to explore the mechanical functions of proteins and
    will be a useful tool for studying the micro-mechanics of

Fundamental mechanisms of the image formation are discussed, and novel imaging modes are introduced that exploit different aspects of the tip-sample interaction for local measurements of the micromechanical properties of the sample. As examples, images of Langmuir-Blodgett films, which map the local viscoelasticity as well as the friction coefficient, are presented.},

    problems can be modularised. Functional languages push those
    limits back. In this paper we show that two features of functional
    languages in particular, higher-order functions and lazy
    evaluation, can contribute greatly to modularity. As examples, we
    manipulate lists and trees, program several numerical algorithms,
    and implement the alpha-beta heuristics (an Artificial

    modularity is the key to successful programming, functional

    (characterized by a persistence length $l$) made up of discrete
    segments or bonds of length $b$ show at large stretching forces a
    crossover from the standard wormlike chain (WLC) behavior to a
    discrete-chain (DC) behavior. In the DC regime, the stretching
    response is independent of the persistence length and shows a
    different force dependence than in the WLC regime. We perform
    extensive transfer-matrix calculations for the force-response of a
    freely rotating chain (FRC) model as a function of varying bond
    angle $\gamma$ (and thus varying persistence length) and chain
    length. The FRC model is a first step toward the understanding of
    the stretching behavior of synthetic polymers, denatured proteins,
    and single-stranded DNA under large tensile forces. We also
    present scaling results for the force response of the elastically
    jointed chain (EJC) model, that is, a chain made up of freely
    jointed bonds that are connected by joints with some bending
    stiffness; this is the discretized version of the continuum WLC
    model. The EJC model might be applicable to stiff biopolymers such
    as double-stranded DNA or Actin. Both models show a similar
    crossover from the WLC to the DC behavior, which occurs at a force
    $f/k_BT\sim l/b^2$ and is thus (for polymers with a moderately
    large persistence length) in the piconewton range probed in many
    AFM experiments. We also give a heuristic simple function for the
    force--distance relation of a FRC, valid in the global force
    range, which can be used to fit experimental data. Our findings
    might help to resolve the discrepancies encountered when trying to
    fit experimental data for the stretching response of polymers in a
    broad force range with a single effective persistence length.},

    1-40, A beta 1-42 fibrils are also defibrillized in the presence

    residues on the surface contributes to the proton shuttling
    function.  In this study, this notion was further investigated by
    the use of molecular dynamics simulations, where Na(+) and Cl(-)
    are the ions under study, thus avoiding the necessity for quantum
    mechanical calculations.  Molecular dynamics simulations were
    carried out using as a model a few Na(+) and Cl(-) ions enclosed
    in a fully hydrated simulation box with a small globular protein
    (the S6 of the bacterial ribosome). Three independent 10-ns-long
    simulations indicated that the ions and the protein's surface were
    in equilibrium, with rapid passage of the ions between the
    protein's surface and the bulk. However, it was noted that close
    to some domains the ions extended their duration near the surface,
    thus suggesting that the local electrostatic potential hindered
    their diffusion to the bulk. During the time frame in which the
    ions were detained next to the surface, they could rapidly shuttle
    between various attractor sites located under the electrostatic
    umbrella. Statistical analysis of the molecular dynamics and
    electrostatic potential/entropy consideration indicated that the

    paper, computer simulations and analysis of protein structures are
    used to characterize the interactions between ions and the protein
    surface. The results show that the ion-binding properties of
    protein residues are highly variable. For example, alkali metal
    ions are more often associated with aspartate residues than with
    glutamates, whereas chlorides are most likely to be located near
    arginines. When comparing NaCl and KCl solutions, it was found
    that certain surface residues attract the anion more strongly in
    NaCl. This study demonstrates that protein-salt interactions
    should be accounted for in the planning and execution of
    experiments and simulations involving proteins, particularly if
    subtle structural details are sought after.},

    physiological mechanisms and factors that predispose to Abeta

    report, we show that calcium can predispose to Abeta aggregation
    and fibril formation. Calcium increased the aggregation of early
    forming protofibrillar structures and markedly increased
    conversion of protofibrils to mature amyloid fibrils. This
    occurred at levels 20-fold below the calcium concentration in the
    extracellular space of the brain, the site at which amyloid plaque
    deposition occurs. In the absence of calcium, protofibrils can
    remain stable in vitro for several days. Using this approach, we
    directly compared the neurotoxicity of protofibrils and mature
    amyloid fibrils and demonstrate that both species are inherently
    toxic to neurons in culture. Thus, calcium may be an important
    predisposing factor for Abeta aggregation and toxicity. The high
    extracellular concentration of calcium in the brain, together with
    impaired intraneuronal calcium regulation in the aging brain and
    Alzheimer disease, may play an important role in the onset of

  abstract = {Amyloid $\beta$-peptide (A$\beta$) is directly linked to
    Alzheimer's disease (AD). In its monomeric form, A$\beta$
    aggregates to produce fibrils and a range of oligomers, the latter
    being the most neurotoxic.  Dysregulation of Ca(2+) homeostasis in
    aging brains and in neurodegenerative disorders plays a crucial
    role in numerous processes and contributes to cell dysfunction and
    death. Here we postulated that calcium may enable or accelerate
    the aggregation of A$\beta$. We compared the aggregation pattern
    of A$\beta$(1-40) and that of A$\beta$(1-40)E22G, an amyloid
    peptide carrying the Arctic mutation that causes early onset of
    the disease.  We found that in the presence of Ca(2+),
    A$\beta$(1-40) preferentially formed oligomers similar to those
    formed by A$\beta$(1-40)E22G with or without added Ca(2+), whereas
    in the absence of added Ca(2+) the A$\beta$(1-40) aggregated to
    form fibrils.  Morphological similarities of the oligomers were
    confirmed by contact mode atomic force microscopy imaging. The
    distribution of oligomeric and fibrillar species in different
    samples was detected by gel electrophoresis and Western blot
    analysis, the results of which were further supported by
    thioflavin T fluorescence experiments. In the samples without
    Ca(2+), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed
    conversion of oligomers from an anti-parallel $\beta$-sheet to the
    parallel $\beta$-sheet conformation characteristic of
    fibrils. Overall, these results led us to conclude that calcium
    ions stimulate the formation of oligomers of A$\beta$(1-40), that
    have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD.},

    the ionic strength-dependent effects on the structure and dynamics

    brought forth by varying the NaCl concentration in the environment
    surrounding the A$\beta$ fibril. Comparison of the calculated

    molecular dynamics simulations at different ionic strength reveals
    the fibril structure to be stiffer with increasing ionic
    strength. This finding is further corroborated by the calculation
    of the stretching force constants. Decomposition of binding and
    dynamical properties into contributions from different structural
    segments indicates the elongation of the fibril at low ionic
    strength is most likely promoted by hydrogen bonding between
    N-terminal parts of the fibril, whereas aggregation at higher

    increasing random coil structure propensities and lifetimes and
    diminishing intrapeptide hydrogen bonding. These effects are
