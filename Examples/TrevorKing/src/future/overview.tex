Single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) provides an experimental
window on the mechanics and kinetics of individual molecules and
domains.  Single molecule measurements extend bulk measurements, by
offering insight into the variations within a population of molecules
in addition to insight into the aggregate behavior of bulk solutions.
They also bridge the gap between chemists experimenting at the bulk
level and theorists simulating at the amino-acid level.  By providing
data for comparison, SMFS lays the ground work for improving and
validating all-atom protein simulations.  These simulations can then
be used in predictive biological applications such as high throughput
drug screening.  By developing open source experiment control and
analysis software, I have made it easier for new labs to get started
in this field and for existing labs to collaborate on critical tools.
I validate my experiment and analysis suite by carring out new
experiments showing that increased \CaCl\ concentration significantly
decreases the stability of folded I27.
