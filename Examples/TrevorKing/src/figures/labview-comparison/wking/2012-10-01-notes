Setup with DI water on an old gold coverslip with a new cantilever
(Asylum Research; Olympus TR400PSA; lot 860135, date 2009-01-20, chip
32/35).

The deflection signal is jumpy.  After flushing in the water, I only
tweaked the photodiode position twice, but there are a number of
discrete jumps in the slow-bend data.


First calibration run without the plastic bell.  It may be noisy
because there are a couple of compressors running in the room, and
I've left the microscope TV on (but with the microcope light off).

First calibration had trouble finding the surface.  Repeat.

Third calibration with the TV off.

Fourth calibration with TV off and the plastic bell, but with the
syringe on the short hose, the bell doesn't seal very well.

Run some pulls with my unfold.py.

Quit and run slow_bend.  After ~20 samples, pull the thermocouple out
of the cell into the air.  After another ~20 samples, wipe dry with a
Kimwipe.

Switch to Marisa's setup (using my DAQ card and not touching the
multimode).
