\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:hooke:conclusions}

My \Hooke\ work builds on previous open source development from other
groups to provide a solid, extensible framework for processing raw
force spectroscopy data.  With this framework, it's easy to add
analysis plugins to support new approaches to data analysis.  It's
also easy to add drivers to support new data file formats.

In it's current state, \Hooke\ is used by a handful of people to
analyze single molecule velocity clamp unfolding experiments.  Even
with Hooke helping out, the process is not automatic.  Because of the
scarcity of clean curves, it's hard to set agressive margins for
automatically filtering clean unfolding sawteeth from curves that
contain other interactions.  Manually identifying clean curves from
the rest is time consuming and subjective.  By writing software to
objectively identify unfolding events, we can improve the quality of
the resulting science while at the same time increasing throughput.
Real world data is messy, so developing objective filtering procedures
is difficult.  With \Hooke's standardized framework and broad support
for existing analysis procedures, it will be easy to apply new
objective filtering procedures to old data, and see how well the new
procedures match up with their partially automated predecessors.
