\chapter{The Gumbel (minimum) distribution}
\label{sec:gumbel}

The Gumbel (minimum) distribution is also refered to as the extreme
value type I distribution distribution\citep{NIST:gumbel}, the
log-Weibull distribution\citep{wikipedia:gumbel}, the double
exponential distribution\citep{wikipedia:gumbel}.  The Gumbel
distribution is often confused with the Gompertz
distribution\citep{wikipedia:gumbel}.  To avoid confusion, we can
express both Gumbel and Gompertz in terms of the Generalized extreme
value distribution (GEV, a.k.a. the Fisher--Tippett
distribution\citep{wikipedia:GEV}), which has a probability
distribution given by

\begin{align}
  P_\text{GEV}(x|\mu,\sigma,\eta)
    &= \frac{1}{\sigma}t(x)\exp{-t(x)} \\
  t(x) &= \begin{cases}
      \p({1 + \p({\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}})\eta})^{-1/\eta} &
        \text{if } \eta \ne 0 \\
      \exp{-\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}} & \text{if } \eta = 0
    \end{cases}
\end{align}
where $\mu\in\Reals$ is the location parameter, $\sigma>0$ is the
scale parameter, and $\eta\in\Reals$ is the shape
parameter\citep{wikipedia:GEV}.

To recover the Gumbel distribution, set $\eta=0$.
\begin{align}
  P_\text{Gumbel}(x|\mu,\sigma)
    &= \frac{1}{\sigma}\exp{-\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}}
       \exp{\exp{-\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}}} \\
    &= \frac{1}{\sigma}\exp{z - \exp(-z)} \;,
\end{align}
where $z\equiv (x-\mu)/\sigma$.  This form matches
\citet{wikipedia:gumbel} and, with the replacements
$\mu\rightarrow\alpha$ and $\sigma\rightarrow\rho$, also matches
\cref{eq:sawsim:gumbel}.

To recover the Gompertz distribution\citet{wikipedia:gompertz}
\begin{align}
  P_\text{Gompertz}(x|\nu,b)
    &= b\nu\exp{bx}\exp{\nu}\exp{-\nu\exp{bx}}
\end{align}
, set $$.

Finally, there are a few other similarly named distributions to watch
out for.  The Type-1 Gumbel distribution\citet{wikipedia:gumbel-t1}
\begin{equation}
  P_\text{Type-1 Gumbel}(x|a,b)
    = ab\exp{-(b\exp{-ax}+ax)}}
    = -\exp{-b}\cdotP_\text{Gompertz})(x|b,-a)
\end{equation}
is similar to the Gompertz distrubution, differing only by a constant
scale factor.  Since both probability distributions are normalized,
the difference comes from the range of allowed $x$.  For the Gompertz
distribution, $x\ge0$.  For the Type-1 Gumbel distribution,
$-\infty<x<\infty$.  Note that the Type-1 Gumbel distribution is not
the same as the Gumbel (minimum) distribution.

The Type-2 Gumbel distribution\citet{wikipedia:gumbel-t2}
\begin{equation}
  P_\text{Type-2 Gumbel}(x|a,b) = abx^{-a-1}\exp{-bx^{-a}}
\end{equation}
has $x$ being raised to powers (vs. $e$ being raised to powers in the
other distributions), so it is an entirely different beast.

Properties of the Bell model recieve more coverage under the name of
the older and equivalent Gompertz
distribution\citep{gompertz25,olshansky97,wu04}.  eq:sawsim:order-depA
warning about the ``Gompertz'' model is in order, because there seem
to be at least two unfolding/dying rate formulas that go by that name.
Compare, for example, \xref{braverman08}{equation}{5} and
\xref{juckett93}{figure}{2}.
