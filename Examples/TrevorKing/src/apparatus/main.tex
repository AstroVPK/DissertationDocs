\chapter{Mechanical protein unfolding via AFM}
\label{sec:methods}

In this chapter we will review the basic methods and procedures for
mechanically unfolding proteins with an atomic force microscope.  We
will discuss the working principle behind an AFM (\cref{sec:afm}) and
outline the procedure for synthesizing protein chains
(\cref{sec:polymer-synthesis}).  With the groundwork out of the way,
we will look at sample preparation (\cref{sec:sample-preparation}) and
the velocity clamp force spectroscopy procedure
(\cref{sec:procedure}).  Finally, we will give a summary of cantilever
calibration (\cref{sec:cantilever-calib:intro}) which is discussed in
more detail in \cref{sec:cantilever-calib}.

Everything discussed in this chapter, with the possible exception of
cantilever calibration, is fairly standard practice in the field of
force spectroscopy.  See \cref{sec:cantilever-calib} for the
development of the cantilever calibration theory from first principles
and references to related papers.
% More specialized techniques such as
% temperature control will be dealt with in their particular chapters
% (e.g. \cref{sec:temperature}).
