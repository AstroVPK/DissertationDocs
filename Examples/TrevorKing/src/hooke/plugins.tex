\section{Plugins for analysis}
\label{sec:hooke:plugins}

Plugins are groups of related commands for processing curves.  Curves
can be stored in playlists, and there are builtin plugins for
administrative tasks like managing curves (getting curve metadata,
exporting blocks, \ldots) and playlists (moving to the next curve,
globbing curves to the playlist, \ldots).  There are also analysis
plugins with commands for doing science.  The \imint{python}|vclamp|
plugin for velocity clamp analysis has commands for finding the
surface contact point, scaling the cantilever deflection, removing the
cantilever deflection from the total extension (\cref{fig:procedure}),
and flattening polynomial drift in the non-contact region.  The
\imint{python}|flatfilt| plugin has commands for identifying peaks
based on spikes in the deflection derivative and for filtering curves
from a playlist that only have more than a minimum threshold of such
peaks\citep{sandal08}.  The \imint{python}|polymer_fit| plugin has
commands for fitting polymer models to the loading peaks
(\cref{sec:sawsim:tension}), which may have been identified using the
\imint{python}|flatfilt| plugin or with any other peak-marking plugin.
For other available plugins, see the \Hooke\ documentation.
