\section{Significance for single molecules experiments}
\label{sec:cantilever:discussion}

\citet{walton08} demonstrated the large effect of cantilever spring
constant on ligand-receptor binding.  Our theoretical, computational,
and experimental results show that this effect, though reduced, is
still important for multi-domain protein unfolding experiments.
Studies attempting precision unfolding force measurements should
account for this effect, but an analytical correction is not
immediately clear.  We suggest the unfolding parameters $k_0$ and
$\Delta x$ be extracted by fitting the per-pulling-speed unfolding
force histograms in parallel with Monte Carlo simulations that take
the effect of cantilever spring constant into effect (such as our
GPLed \emph{sawsim} simulator, available at\\
