       \emph{Materials and Data Availability.}  To allow others to
       replicate and build on work published in PNAS, authors must
       make materials, data, and associated protocols available to
       readers.  \ldots Data not shown and personal communications
       cannot be used to support claims in the work.  Authors are
       encouraged to use SI to show all neces- sary data.  Authors are
       encouraged to deposit as much of their data as possible in
       publicly accessible databases.  \ldots

      A condition of publication in a Nature journal is that authors
      are required to make materials, data and associated protocols
      promptly available to others without undue qualifications.

      Data sets must be made freely available to readers from the date
      of publication, and must be provided to editors and
      peer-reviewers at submission, for the purposes of evaluating the
      manuscript.
