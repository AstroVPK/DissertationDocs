\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:calibcant:conclusions}

Thermal cantilever calibration has been common practice for many years
now\citep{hutter93,florin95}, starting with estimates of thermal
noise\citep{martin87}.  However, discussion and explicit derivations
have been limited.  While this is likely done because the underlying
theory is ``obvious'', it makes it more likely that corner cases slip
by the notice of calibration experts\citep{hutter93-erratum} or
incorrect formul\ae\ are used during the fitting
(\cref{sec:calibcant:lorentzian}).  By centralizing calibration
procedures in an open package, \calibcant\ should both reduce the
effort needed to calibrate AFM cantilevers, improve the quality of the
calibration, and ease data sharing and archival.
