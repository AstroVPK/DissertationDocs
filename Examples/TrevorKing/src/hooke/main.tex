\chapter{Data analysis with \Hooke}
\label{sec:hooke}

Individual unfolding force curves acquired with the \pyafm\ stack
(\cref{sec:pyafm}) are hard to compare with other experimental data.
One way to analyze them in bulk is to extract unfolding force
histograms.  These experimental histograms can then be used for
fitting simulated models with \sawsim\ (\cref{sec:sawsim}), and the
model fitting parameters will summarize the kinetic behavior.  In this
chapter, I'll discuss the histogram extraction procedure and the
\Hooke\ package that facilitates it.
