  note = {SWIG, the simplified wrapper and interface generator, makes
    it easy to wrap C and C++ libraries for use from higher level
    scripting languages like Python.  Often, you don't need much more
    than the library's header file to generate a full wrapper.
    However, the generated wrappers are usually very thin, which can
    make them awkward to use.  If you want to write a thicker, more
    idiomatic wrapper, it's probably easier to use a tool like
    \citetalias{cython} instead of SWIG.},
