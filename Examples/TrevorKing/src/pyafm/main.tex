\epigraph{Civilization advances by extending the number of important
  operations which we can perform without thinking about
  them. Operations of thought are like cavalry charges in a
  battle---they are strictly limited in number, they require fresh
  horses, and must only be made at decisive moments.}{Alfred North
  Whitehead\citep{whitehead11}}
