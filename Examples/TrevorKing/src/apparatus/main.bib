  note = "OMCL-TR400PSA.  From
    \href{http://www.asylumresearch.com/Probe/TR400PSA,Olympus}{Asylum
    Research}, the small cantilever has a spring constant
    $\kappa=0.08(0.02-0.23)\U{N/m}$, a length of
    $100(90-110)\U{$\mu$m}$, a width of $15(14-16)\U{$\mu$m}$, and a
    thickness of $0.4(0.3-0.5)\U{$\mu$m}$.  The tip is a four-sided
    pyramid with a height of $3.0\pm0.5\U{$\mu$m}$, a side angle of
    $35\pm1\dg$, and a tip radius of $20\pm5\U{nm}$.  The cantilevers
    are silicon nitride, with chromium and gold reflex coatings that
    are $5$ and $30\U{nm}$ thick respectively.  From
    \href{http://probe.olympus-global.com/en/product/omcl_tr400psa_hw/}{Olympus},
    the resonant frequency of the small cantilever in water is around
    $7\U{kHz}$.",
